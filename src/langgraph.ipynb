       "'The Miracle of Compound Interest\\nAlbert Einstein said, “Compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe.”\\nIf, from the age of twenty-one until you are sixty-five, you were to save only $100 per month and\\ninvest that amount in a mutual fund or index fund that increased an average of 7 to 10 percent per year,\\nyou would be worth more than a million dollars. If you were to set up your payroll account so that\\n$100 were automatically deducted and invested for you, you could be sure of becoming one of the\\nwealthiest people in America.\\nThis means that if you are serious about achieving financial independence, the most important\\nsingle requirement is self-discipline combined with the ability to delay gratification. Your ability to\\npractice self-mastery, self-control, and self-denial throughout your life will not only enable you to\\nachieve all your financial goals, but it will also make you successful and happy in everything else you\\ndo.\\nIn the next chapter, we will talk about the key to making almost everything in your life work for\\nyou: the use of your time. We all start off in life with lots of time and little money. How you spend\\nyour time throughout your adult years largely determines the quality of your life.\\nAction Exercises:\\n \\n1. Make a decision today to take complete control of your financial life, get out of\\ndebt, and achieve financial independence.\\n2. Determine your net worth today. Add up all your assets, subtract all your debts and\\nliabilities, and calculate the exact number.\\n3. Set up a separate bank account and begin saving at least 1 percent of your income as\\nyou receive it every month or paycheck.\\n4. Make a list of all your debts and begin paying them off, starting with those carrying\\nthe highest interest rates.\\n5. Calculate the exact amount that you will need to be financially independent at the\\nend of your career and then set this as a goal.\\n6. Set specific financial accumulation goals for yourself for each month, quarter, and\\nyear for the rest of your life.\\n7. Practice frugality in spending by putting off and delaying every expenditure you\\npossibly can until you achieve your long-term financial goals.'"
