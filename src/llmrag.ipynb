Exercise play avital role in preventing health diseases and stroke. The health benefits of doing \\nregular Exercise have been shown in many studies. This paper review the evidence of the benefits of \\nexercise for all the body systems. Physical activity and exercise can reduce stress and anxiety, boost \\nhappy chemicals, improve self-confidence, increase the brain power, sharpen the memory and increase \\nour muscles and bones strength. It also helps in preventing and reducing heart disease, obesity, blood \\nsugar fluctuations, cardiovascular diseases and Cancer. \\n \\nKeywords: sports, need, exercise, benefits, physical activity, importance \\n \\n1. Introduction \\nPhysical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that require \\nenergy expenditure. The term “Physical activity” is not equal to “exercise”. Exercise is a \\nsubcategory of physical activity which is structured, repetitive, and purposeful [1]. “A sound \\nbody has a sound mind” It means that if a person is weak, dull, and sick, he is not able to do \\nhis work efficiently and quickly. It is very important to have a fresh mind before any work, \\nlike office work, study or some creative work. The people who make exercise as essential part \\nof their routine are more happy and efficient than others. Exercise does not mean to go to gym \\nor some club for daily activity; it only means to do some physical activity no matter how and \\nwhere. Exercise is useful in preventing or treating coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, \\nweakness, diabetes, obesity, and depression. Strengthening exercises provide appropriate \\nresistance to the muscles to increase endurance and strength. Cardiac rehabilitation exercises \\nare developed and individualized to improve the cardiovascular system for prevention and \\nrehabilitation of cardiac disorders and diseases. A well-balanced exercise program can \\nimprove general health, build endurance, and slow many of the effects of aging. The benefits \\nof exercise not only improve physical health, but also enhance emotional well-being. Regular \\nphysical activity remains an essential behavior for endorsing health, postponing or preventing \\npredominant musculoskeletal disorders such as mechanical low back pain, neck and shoulder \\npain and decreasing the risk of increasing coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, \\nosteoporosis, obesity and colon cancers [2, 3]. The period of adolescence represents the \\ntransition from childhood to adulthood and lifetime habits such as regular exercise are \\nnormally begun at this time [4]. But unfortunately research indicated that physical activity rates \\ndecline consistently during the adolescent years [5, 6]. No matter what your age or shape, you \\nshould exercise daily. Not only does exercise so you can wear your favorite dress, it \\nstrengthens your muscles, keeps your bones strong, and improves your skin, increased \\nrelaxation, better sleep and mood, strong immune function, and more. Daily exercise helps in \\nstrengthening of heart muscles. It helps maintain desired cholesterol levels. Daily physical \\nactivity reduces one’s chances of stroke and the risk of heart disease. Regular exercise lowers \\nblood pressure and improves blood circulation. Exercise helps in reduction of excess body \\nweight leading to lower blood pressure. Exercise results in the burning of calories. If \\nsupplemented with proper nutrition, exercise is the way to prevent obesity. Any healthy person \\nmay become unfit physically if he does not practice exercise regularly. The efficiency of our \\nmuscles reduces if we are not doing regular physical workout. So we must do physical fitness \\nexercises every day. Exercise is linked with many physical and physiological benefits that help'),\n",

Exercise \\nprovides an entertaining way to spend enjoyable time. People \\nof all age who are usually inactive can improve their health \\nand well-being by becoming active at a level of moderate \\nintensity in daily basis. Regular Exercise significantly reduces \\nthe high blood pressure, risk of developing heart disease, \\nstroke, some cancers, diabetes, and may help to remove the \\nstress, anxiety, and depression. At any age, being physically fit \\nis an advantage to your overall health. \\n \\n2. Exercise \\nExercise is a subcategory of physical activity that is planned, \\nstructured, and repetitive for the purpose of conditioning any \\npart of the body. Exercise is used to improve health, maintain \\nfitness and is important as a means of physical rehabilitation. \\nAlso we can define exercise as any bodily movement \\nperformed in order to develop or maintain physical fitness and \\noverall health.  \\n \\n3. Types of exercise \\nExercise and physical activity fall into four basic categories—\\nendurance, strength, balance, and flexibility. Most people have \\na habit of to focus on one activity or type of exercise and think \\nthey're doing enough for their health. Each type of exercise is \\ndifferent, however, doing them all will give you extra benefits. \\nMixing it up also helps to reduce boredom and stop the \\npossibility of injury. \\n \\n3.1 Endurance \\nEndurance, or aerobic, activities increase your breathing and \\nheart rate. They keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system \\nhealthy and improve your overall fitness. Building your \\nendurance makes it easier to carry out many of your everyday \\nactivities. Walking or jogging, mowing, raking, digging and \\nDancing are kinds of this type. \\n \\n3.2 Strength \\nStrength exercises make your muscles stronger. Even small \\nincreases in strength can make a big difference in your ability. \\nWe can find this type of exercise in Lifting weights, using a \\nresistance band with your own body weight. \\n \\n3.3 Balance \\nBalance exercises help prevent falls, a public problem in older \\nadults. Many lower-body strength exercises also will improve \\nyour balance. This type can be noticeable in Standing on one \\nfoot, Heel-to-toe walk and Tai Chi. \\n \\n3.4 Flexibility \\nFlexibility exercises stretch your muscles and can help your \\nbody stay limber. Being flexible gives you more freedom of \\nmovement for other exercises as well as for your everyday \\nactivities. Some examples for that in Shoulder and upper arm \\nstretch, Calf stretch and Yoga. \\n \\n3.5 Depending on the overall effect on the human body \\nPhysical exercises can be generally grouped into two types: [7] \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large \\nmuscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen \\nthan it would while resting. The goal of aerobic exercise is \\nto increase cardiovascular endurance [8]. Examples of \\naerobic exercise include cycling, swimming, brisk \\nwalking, skipping rope, rowing, hiking, playing tennis, \\ncontinuous training, and long slow distance training.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nAnaerobic exercise, which includes strength and \\nresistance training, can firm, strengthen, and tone muscles, \\nas well as improve bone strength, balance, and \\ncoordination. Examples of strength moves are push-ups, \\nlunges, and bicep curls using dumbbells. Anaerobic \\nexercise also include weight training, functional training, \\neccentric training, Interval training, sprinting, and high-\\nintensity interval training increase short-term muscle \\nstrength [9]. \\n \\n3.6 According to the intensities of the exercise it can also \\ndivided to three categories, heart Rate is typically used as a \\nmeasure of exercise intensity [10]. Heart rate can be an \\nindicator of the challenge to the cardiovascular system that \\nthe exercise represents [11, 12]. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nLight exercise: Does not induce sweating unless it's a hot, \\nhumid day. There is no obvious change in breathing \\npatterns, sleeping, writing, desk work, typing, very slow \\nwalking, are examples for the first category. \\n\\uf0b7 \\nModerate exercise: It should raise your heart rate, make \\nyou breathe faster and make you feel warm enough to start \\nto sweat after performing the activity for about 10 \\nminutes. Breathing becomes deeper and more frequent. \\nYou can carry on a conversation but not sing, bicycling, \\nvery light effort, calisthenics, home exercise, light or \\nmoderate effort are examples for the second one.  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nVigorous exercise: will make you breathe hard, increase \\nyour heart rate significantly and make you hot enough to \\nsweat profusely after 3-5 minutes. Breathing is deep and \\nrapid. You can only talk in short phrases, the examples for \\nthis type include running, jogging, jogging in place, \\ncalisthenics (e.g. pushups, sit-ups, pullups, jumping \\njacks), heavy vigorous effort, rope jumping. \\n \\n4. Need of Exercise \\nEverybody knows that the need of exercise in our daily lives, \\nbut we may not know why or what exercise can do for us. \\nExercise means, the daily practice of doing some physical \\nwork. Exercise is the key to good health and fresh mind [13]. \\nThe daily practice of some physical work does not mean to \\ntake stress on body, but it is actually the stress relieving \\nactivity. A good health is obligatory for doing a good work. A \\nfamous quote is there is awesome evidence that people who \\nlead active lifestyles are less likely to suffer from illness and \\nmore likely to live longer. Exercise not only makes you \\nphysically fitter but it also improves your mental health and \\ngeneral sense of well-being. Getting fit is not just about \\nrunning on a treadmill for hours in your local gym, it can be a \\ndance class or a new hobby like fencing or mountain biking. It \\ncould be a group or team activity like football or a karate class. \\nWhatever form of exercise you choose, you’ll practically \\ncertainly meet new people and may make new friendships. \\nThese recommendations can be achieved through 30-60 \\nminutes of moderate-intensity exercise (five times a week) or \\n20-60 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise (three times a \\nweek) or a combination of both types. One continuous session \\ncombined with multiple shorter sessions (of at least 10 \\nminutes) is also acceptable [14].  \\n \\n5. Importance of Exercise \\nEach one of us has a physical body made of muscles, blood, \\nbones and various other living tissue. When any of these are \\ninjured or not working properly then we get ill. Nobody likes \\nto be ill. So, it is important that we keep our body healthy and \\nfit. Exercising the body is one way of keeping it healthy. If we \\ndo not exercise then our muscles become weaker and we are\"),\n",

Also the bones can become \\nweaker and thus break easily. It is performed for various \\nreasons, including increasing growth and development, \\npreventing aging, strengthening muscles and the cardiovascular \\nsystem, honing athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, and \\nmerely enjoyment. Frequent and regular physical exercise \\nboosts the immune system and helps prevent \"diseases of \\naffluence\" such as cardiovascular, type 2 diabetes, and obesity \\n[15, 16]. It may also help prevent stress and depression, increase \\nquality of sleep and act as a non-pharmaceutical sleep aid to \\ntreat diseases such as insomnia, help promote or maintain \\npositive self-esteem, improve mental health, maintain steady \\ndigestion and treat constipation and gas, regulate fertility \\nhealth, and augment an individual\\'s sex appeal or body image, \\nwhich has been found to be linked with higher levels of self-\\nesteem [17, 18]. Childhood obesity is a growing global concern, \\n[19] and physical exercise may help decrease some of the \\neffects of childhood and adult obesity. Some care providers \\ncall exercise the \"miracle\" or \"wonder\" drug—alluding to the \\nwide variety of benefits that it can provide for many \\nindividuals [20, 21]. \\nIn the United Kingdom two to four hours of light activity are \\nrecommended during working hours [22]. This includes walking \\nand standing. In the United States, the CDC/ACSM consensus \\nstatement and the Surgeon General\\'s report states that every \\nadult should participate in moderate exercise, such as walking, \\nswimming, and household tasks, for a minimum of 30 minutes \\ndaily [23]. \\n \\n6. Benefits of Exercise \\nRegular exercise makes the heart stronger and the lungs fitter, \\nenabling the cardiovascular system to deliver more oxygen to \\nthe body with every heartbeat and the pulmonary system to \\nincrease the maximum amount of oxygen that the lungs can \\ntake in. Exercise lowers blood pressure, slightly decreases the \\nlevels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol \\n(the bad cholesterol), and increases the level of high-density \\nlipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the good cholesterol). These \\nhelpful effects decrease the risk of heart attack, stroke, and \\ncoronary artery disease. In addition, colon cancer and some \\nforms of diabetes are less likely to occur in people who \\nexercise regularly [24]. Exercise makes muscles stronger, \\nallowing people to do tasks that they otherwise might not be \\nable to do or to do them more easily. Every physical task \\nrequires muscle strength and some degree of range of motion \\nin joints. Regular exercise can improve both of these qualities. \\nExercise stretches muscles and joints, which in turn can \\nincrease flexibility and help prevent injuries. Exercise may \\nalso improve balance by increasing strength of the tissues \\naround joints and throughout the body, thus helping to prevent \\nfalls. Weight-bearing exercise, such as brisk walking and \\nweight training, strengthens bones and helps prevent \\nosteoporosis. Other health benefits include the following: \\n \\n6.1 Reduce stress and anxiety \\nStress relief is one of the most common mental benefits of \\nexercise. Regular Exercise can help to manage physical and \\nmental stress. Exercise also increases concentrations of \\nnorepinephrine, a chemical that can moderate the brain’s \\nresponse to stress. Being active greatly causes a reduction in \\ntress levels. Aerobic and anaerobic physical training helpful \\nfor overall health. Study suggests that 30 Minutes Exercise for \\n5 or more days in a week, it helps in lowering the desperation \\nand mental stress [25]. On the other hand Physical activity \\nmakes you more tired so you’re more ready to sleep. Good \\nquality sleep helps improve overall wellness and can reduce \\nstress. Regarding anxiety, the warm and chemicals that are \\nreleased during and after any physical exercise can help people \\nwith anxiety disorders calm down [26]. Jumping on the track or \\ntreadmill for some moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise \\ncan reduce anxiety sensitivity [27]. \\n \\n6.2 Boost happy chemicals \\nExercise releases endorphins, which create feelings of \\nhappiness and euphoria. Studies have shown that exercise can \\neven improve symptoms among the clinically depressed [28]. \\nFor this reason, doctors recommend that people suffering from \\ndepression or anxiety. In some cases, exercise can be just as \\neffective as antidepressant pills in treating depression. Higher \\nenergy levels resulting from exercise help a person in \\nremaining fresh and happy. Following a suitable exercise \\nprogram can add some fun and brightness to the day. Working \\nout for just 30 minutes a few times a week can instantly boost \\noverall mood. \\n \\n6.3 Improve self-Confidence and self-Image \\nPhysical fitness can boost self-esteem and improve positive \\nself-image. Regardless of weight, size, gender, or age, exercise \\ncan quickly elevate a person\\'s perception of his or her \\nattractiveness, that is, self-worth [29]. It has been proved that in \\nless time of aerobic exercise and resistance training method \\ndefinitely will help to improve self-image [30]. One of the latest \\nresearch was in consistency with most of the previous studies \\nwhich found significant relationship between physical activity \\nand self-esteem by using different study designs and self-\\nesteem scales. This finding can be considered to recommend \\nincreased physical activity participation for college student \\nwho face self-esteem problems [31]. Even if you will take your \\nworkout outside and start Exercising in the great outdoors can \\nalso increase self-esteem even more [32]. \\n \\n6.4 Increase brainpower \\nVarious studies on mice and men have shown that \\ncardiovascular exercise can create new brain cells (aka \\nneurogenesis) and improve overall brain performance [33]. \\nStudies suggest that a vigorous workout increases levels of a \\nbrain-derived protein (known as BDNF) in the body, believed \\nto help with decision making, higher thinking, and learning [34].  \\n \\n6.5 Sharpen memory \\nRegular physical activity increases memory and ability to learn \\nnew things. Getting sweaty increases production of cells in \\nhippocampus responsible for memory and learning [35]. For this \\nreason, research has linked children’s brain development with \\nlevel of physical fitness, but exercise-based brainpower isn’t \\njust for kids, regular exercise can boost memory among adults, \\ntoo. A study showed that running sprints improved vocabulary \\nretention among healthy adults [36].  \\n \\n6.6 Improves muscles and bones strength  \\nExercise involves a series of sustained muscle contractions, of \\neither long or short duration, depending on the nature of the \\nphysical activity. Muscle-strengthening activities can help you \\nincrease or maintain your muscle mass and strength. Strong \\nmuscles and ligaments reduce your risk of joint and lower \\nback pain by keeping joints in proper alignment. Additionally, \\nwith exercise improvements to the circulatory and respiratory \\nsystems can facilitate better delivery of oxygen and glucose to \\nthe muscle [37]. Research shows that doing aerobics bone-\\nstrengthening physical activity of at least a moderately-intense'),\n",

But research shows that people who do 120 to 300 \\nminutes of at least moderate-intensity aerobic activity each \\nweek have a lower risk of hip fracture [38]. \\n \\n \\n \\n6.7 Reduce the Risk of Heart Diseases  \\nThe heart is a muscle and needs exercise to stay in shape. \\nWhen it's exercised, the heart can pump more blood through \\nthe body and continue working at optimal efficiency with little \\nstrain. This will likely help it to stay healthy longer. Regular \\nexercise also helps to keep arteries and other blood vessels \\nflexible, ensuring good blood flow and normal blood pressure. \\nDaily exercise helps in strengthening of heart muscles. It helps \\nmaintain desired cholesterol levels. Daily physical activity \\nreduces one’s chances of stroke and the risk of heart disease. \\nAccording to the American Heart Association (AHA), \\nexercising 30 minutes a day, five days a week will improve \\nyour heart health and help reduce your risk of heart disease. \\nYou can even break it up into quick and manageable 10-\\nminute sessions, three times a day [39]. \\n \\n6.8 Preventing Obesity \\nObesity and overweight are associated with increased risk for \\nhypertension, \\nosteoarthritis, \\nabnormal \\ncholesterol \\nand \\ntriglyceride levels, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, \\nstroke, gallbladder disease, sleep apnea, respiratory problems \\nand some cancers [40]. Obesity is a significant health problem \\nall over the world for all ages. Genetics can play a role in the \\npossibility that a person will become obese, the condition \\noccurs when the amount of calories consumed exceeds the \\namount of calories expended over a long period of time. The \\nmore you exercise, the easier it is to keep your weight under \\ncontrol. Excess calories are stored as fat in the body, and with \\nlong-term caloric excess, an individual eventually becomes \\nobese. Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help \\nmaintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, \\nyou burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more \\ncalories you burn. Regular exercise (and proper nutrition) can \\nhelp reduce body fat. Weight loss will achieve most effectively \\nwhen we follow a cardiovascular exercise of moderate-\\nintensity activity accumulated over 5-7 days per week. Eating \\na healthy diet are ways in which to combat obesity [41]. \\n \\n6.9 Exercise and Diabetes \\nDiabetes and exercise go hand in hand, at least when it comes \\nto managing your diabetes. Exercise can help you improve \\nyour blood sugar control, boost your overall fitness, and \\nreduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. But diabetes and \\nexercise pose unique challenges, too. To exercise safely, it's \\ncrucial to track your blood sugar before, during and after \\nphysical activity. You'll learn how your body responds to \\nexercise, which can help you prevent potentially dangerous \\nblood sugar fluctuations. The affect physical activity has on \\nyour blood glucose will vary depending on how long you are \\nactive and many other factors. Physical activity can lower your \\nblood glucose up to 24 hours or more after your work out by \\nmaking your body more sensitive to insulin [42]. \\n \\n6.10 Exercise and Cancer \\nExercise is one of the most important actions you can take to \\nhelp guard against many types of cancer. Up to one-third of \\ncancer-related deaths are due to obesity and a sedentary \\nlifestyle, including two of the most common cancers in the \\nUnited States, breast and colon cancer [43]. \\nMany people exercise to prevent heart disease, but exercise \\ncan also play a key role in preventing and reducing the danger \\nof many cancers. It is estimated that 30 to 60 minutes of \\nmoderate to vigorous physical activity per day is needed to \\nprotect against colon cancer, endometrial cancer and lung \\ncancer [44, 45]. Most studies suggest that 30 to 60 minutes per day \\nof moderate- to high-intensity physical activity is associated \\nwith a reduction in breast cancer risk also, there is one recent \\nstudy suggested that regular vigorous activity could slow the \\nprogression of prostate cancer in men age 65 or older [46]. \\n \\n7. Conclusion \\nExercise not only makes you physically fitter but it also \\nimproves your all body health and general sense of well-being. \\nPhysical activity or exercise can reduce the risk of developing \\nseveral diseases like type 2 diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular \\ndisease. Daily exercise can reduce stress and anxiety, boost \\nhappy chemicals, improve self-confidence, increase the brain \\npower, sharpen the memory and increase our muscles and \\nbones strength. Physical activity and exercise can have \\nimmediate and long-term health benefits. Most importantly, \\nregular activity can improve your quality of life. A minimum \\nof 30 minutes a day can allow you to enjoy these benefits.  \\n \\n8.

Moving \\nmore and sitting less have tremendous benefits for everyone, regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or current \\nfitness level. Individuals with a chronic disease or a disability benefit from regular physical activity, as do \\nwomen who are pregnant. The scientific evidence continues to build—physical activity is linked with even more \\npositive health outcomes than we previously thought. And, even better, benefits can start accumulating with \\nsmall amounts of, and immediately after doing, physical activity. \\nToday, about half of all American adults—117 million people—have one or more preventable chronic diseases. \\nSeven of the ten most common chronic diseases are favorably influenced by regular physical activity. Yet nearly \\n80 percent of adults are not meeting the key guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity, \\nwhile only about half meet the key guidelines for aerobic physical activity. This lack of physical activity is linked  \\nto approximately $117 billion in annual health care costs and about 10 percent of premature mortality. \\nThis new edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans has the potential to change that situation. It \\nis grounded in the most current scientific evidence and informed by the recommendations of the 2018 Physical \\nActivity Guidelines Advisory Committee. This Federal advisory committee, which was composed of prestigious \\nresearchers in the fields of physical activity, health, and medicine, conducted a multifaceted, robust analysis \\nof the available scientific literature. Their work culminated in the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory \\nCommittee Scientific Report, which provided recommendations to the Federal Government on physical activity, \\nsedentary behavior, and health. Informed by this Scientific Report and by public and Federal agency comments, \\nthe new edition provides guidance on the amounts and types of physical activity necessary to maintain or \\nimprove overall health and reduce the risk of, or even prevent, chronic disease. \\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans is an essential resource for health professionals and \\npolicymakers as they design and implement physical activity programs, policies, and promotion initiatives. \\nIt provides information that helps Americans make healthy choices for themselves and their families, and \\ndiscusses evidence-based, community-level interventions that can make being physically active the easy \\nchoice in all the places where people live, learn, work, and play.\\nProgress to reverse the high rates of inactivity-related chronic diseases and low rates of physical activity will \\nrequire comprehensive and coordinated strategies. The Physical Activity Guidelines is an important part of a \\ncomplex and integrated solution to promote health and to reduce the burden of chronic disease in our country. \\nWe all have a role to play in this critical effort. I invite you to join me in helping our country be more physically \\nactive. If we all move more and sit less today and work toward meeting the Physical Activity Guidelines \\nourselves, we will be well on our way to creating a healthier Nation and ensuring everyone can live healthier \\nand more active lives. \\nAlex M.

The evidence reviewed for this second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans is \\nclear—physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make people feel better, function \\nbetter, sleep better, and reduce the risk of a large number of chronic diseases. Health benefits start immediately \\nafter exercising, and even short episodes of physical activity are beneficial. Even better, research shows that \\njust about everyone gains benefits: men and women of all races and ethnicities, young children to older adults, \\nwomen who are pregnant or postpartum (first year after delivery), people living with a chronic condition or a \\ndisability, and people who want to reduce their risk of chronic disease. The evidence about the health benefits \\nof regular physical activity is well established, and research continues to provide insight into what works to get \\npeople moving, both at the individual and community level. Achieving the benefits of physical activity depends \\non our personal efforts to increase activity in ourselves, family, friends, patients, and colleagues. Action is also \\nrequired at the school, workplace, and community levels. \\nWhat’s New in This Edition? \\nThis second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans provides science-based guidance to help \\npeople ages 3 years and older improve their health through participation in regular physical activity. It reflects \\nthe extensive amount of new knowledge gained since the publication of the first Physical Activity Guidelines \\nfor Americans, released in 2008. This edition of the Guidelines discusses the proven benefits of physical activity \\nand outlines the amounts and types of physical activity recommended for different ages and populations. For \\nexample, new aspects include discussions of:\\n  \\n• Additional health benefits related to brain health, additional cancer sites, and fall-related injuries;\\n  \\n• Immediate and longer term benefits for how people feel, function, and sleep;\\n  \\n• Further benefits among older adults and people with additional chronic conditions;\\n  \\n• Risks of sedentary behavior and their relationship with physical activity;\\n  \\n• Guidance for preschool children (ages 3 through 5 years);\\n  \\n• Elimination of the requirement for physical activity of adults to occur in bouts of at least 10 minutes; \\nand\\n  \\n• Tested strategies that can be used to get the population more active. \\nDeveloping the Physical Activity Guidelines \\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans is issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \\n(HHS). It complements the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a joint effort of HHS and the U.S. Department of \\nAgriculture (USDA). Together, the two documents provide guidance for the public on the importance of being \\nphysically active and eating a healthy diet to promote good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.'),\n",

The Committee conducted a series of systematic reviews \\nof the scientific literature on physical activity and health and met periodically in public session to discuss their \\nfindings. The Committee’s work was compiled into a scientific report summarizing the current evidence.

The later chapters \\nprovide context and additional information related to these summary statements. \\nKey Guidelines for Preschool-Aged Children\\n•  Preschool-aged children (ages 3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day\\nto enhance growth and development.\\n•  Adult caregivers of preschool-aged children should encourage active play that includes a variety\\nof activity types.\\nKey Guidelines for Children and Adolescents\\n•  It is important to provide young people opportunities and encouragement to participate in\\nphysical activities that are appropriate for their age, that are enjoyable, and that offer variety.\\n•  Children and adolescents ages 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes (1 hour) or more of\\nmoderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily:\\n•\\nAerobic: Most of the 60 minutes or more per day should be either moderate- or vigorous-\\nintensity aerobic physical activity and should include vigorous-intensity physical activity on\\nat least 3 days a week.\\n•\\nMuscle-strengthening: As part of their 60 minutes or more of daily physical activity,\\nchildren and adolescents should include muscle-strengthening physical activity on at least\\n3 days a week.\\n•\\nBone-strengthening: As part of their 60 minutes or more of daily physical activity,\\nchildren and adolescents should include bone-strengthening physical activity on at least\\n3 days a week.\\nKey Guidelines for Adults\\n•  Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day. Some physical activity is better than\\nnone. Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity gain\\nsome health benefits.\\n•  For substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) to\\n300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) to 150 \\nminutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an\\nequivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Preferably, aerobic\\nactivity should be spread throughout the week.\\n•  Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent of\\n300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week.\\n•  Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and that\\ninvolve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional\\nhealth benefits.'),\n",

Physical activity is a leading \\nexample of how lifestyle choices have a profound effect on \\nhealth. The choices people make about other lifestyle factors, \\nsuch as diet, smoking, and alcohol use, also have important \\nand independent effects on their health. \\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans is designed to \\nprovide information and guidance on the types and amounts of physical activity that provide substantial health \\nbenefits. The primary audience is policy makers and health professionals, though this information may also be \\nuseful to interested members of the public. The main idea behind the Guidelines is that regular physical activity \\nover months and years can produce long-term health benefits. \\nThe information in the Guidelines is necessary because of the importance of physical activity to the health of \\nAmericans, whose current inactivity puts them at unnecessary risk. Healthy People 2020 set objectives for \\nincreasing the level of physical activity in Americans over the decade from 2010 to 2020. Although the latest \\ninformation shows some improvements in physical activity levels among American adults, only 26 percent of \\nmen, 19 percent of women, and 20 percent of adolescents report sufficient activity to meet the relevant aerobic \\nand muscle-strengthening guidelines (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2).\\nLearn More \\nSee Chapter 2.

It served as the  \\nfirst benchmark and primary, authoritative voice of the Federal Government for providing science-based \\nguidance on physical activity, fitness, and health for Americans. The Guidelines provides a foundation  \\nfor Federal recommendations and education for physical activity programs for Americans, including  \\nthose at risk of chronic disease. Since 2008, HHS has reaffirmed the health benefits of physical activity  \\nin several publications. \\nIn 2013, 5 years after the Guidelines was released, HHS developed the Physical Activity Guidelines for \\nAmericans Midcourse Report: Strategies to Increase Physical Activity Among Youth. This report built on the \\n2008 Guidelines for Americans by focusing on strategies to help youth achieve the recommended 60 minutes \\nof daily physical activity in a variety of settings, including school, preschool and childcare, community, family \\nand home, and primary care. \\nIn 2015, HHS released Step It Up! The Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Promote Walking and Walkable \\nCommunities. The Call to Action seeks to increase walking across the United States by calling for improved \\naccess to safe and convenient places to walk and wheelchair roll and to create a culture that supports these \\nactivities for people of all ages and abilities. \\nBecause the evidence for the health benefits of a physically active lifestyle continued to grow rapidly, HHS \\nbegan the process of developing a second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans in \\nDecember 2015. HHS called for nominations to the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee and \\nfollowed a similar development process to those used for the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans \\nand the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. In 2016, former HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell \\nappointed 17 members to the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee, an external scientific \\nadvisory committee chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (Public Law 92-463,  \\n5 U.S.C. App.). The Committee conducted an extensive analysis of the scientific information on physical activity \\nand health and met periodically in public session to discuss their findings. \\nThe Committee graded the evidence based on consistency and quality of the research literature. Evidence \\ngraded as strong or moderate was used as the basis for the Guidelines. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines \\nAdvisory Committee Scientific Report and summaries of the Committee’s public meetings are available  \\nat https://odphp.health.gov/PAGuidelines/. \\nWhen writing the Guidelines, HHS used the Advisory Committee’s Scientific Report as its primary source but \\nalso considered comments from the public and government agencies.

Introducing the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans      19 \\nThe Framework for the Physical Activity  \\nGuidelines for Americans\\nThe 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report provided the content and \\nconceptual underpinning for the Guidelines. Key elements of this framework are described in the  \\nfollowing sections.\\nDisease Prevention and Health Promotion\\nThe 2008 Advisory Committee Report and the 2008 Guidelines focused primarily on the disease prevention \\nbenefits of physical activity. The 2018 Scientific Report \\ndemonstrates that, in addition to disease prevention benefits, \\nregular physical activity provides a variety of other benefits, \\nincluding helping people sleep better, feel better, and perform \\ndaily tasks more easily. The 2018 Scientific Report also notes \\nimmediate benefits of physical activity in addition to those \\nrelated to regular physical activity over months or years. \\nThis broader focus on both disease prevention and health \\npromotion is embedded in the key guidelines for the amounts and types of physical activity that are provided \\nfor three age groups (children and adolescents, adults, and older adults), for women who are pregnant or \\npostpartum, and for adults with chronic diseases or adults with disabilities.\\nStrong evidence demonstrates that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity improves the quality of sleep in \\nadults. It does so by reducing the length of time it takes to go to sleep and reducing the time one is awake after \\ngoing to sleep and before rising in the morning. It also can increase the time in deep sleep and reduce daytime \\nsleepiness.\\nStrong evidence from adults demonstrates that perceived quality of life is improved by regular physical activity. \\nThe Guidelines focuses on selected aspects of health-related quality of life, including both physical and mental \\nor emotional health. It does not include other aspects of quality of life, such as those related to finances, \\nrelationships, or occupations.\\nPhysical activity improves physical function among individuals of all ages, enabling them to conduct their daily \\nlives with energy and without undue fatigue. This is true for older adults, for whom improved physical function \\nreduces risk of falls and fall-related injuries and contributes to their ability to maintain independence. It is also \\ntrue for young and middle-aged adults, as improved physical function helps them more easily accomplish the \\ntasks of daily living, such as climbing stairs or carrying groceries. \\nIn addition to improving physical function, physical activity may improve cognitive function among youth and \\nadults. Aspects of cognitive function that may be improved include memory, attention, executive function (the \\nability to plan and organize; monitor, inhibit, or facilitate behaviors; initiate tasks; and control emotions), and \\nacademic performance among youth.\\nLearn More\\nSee Chapter 2. Physical Activity \\nand Health for more information on the \\nmany health benefits of physical activity.'),\n",

Most of these improvements become even larger with the regular performance of moderate-to-\\nvigorous physical activity. Other benefits, such as disease risk reduction and improved physical function, accrue \\nwithin days to weeks after consistently being more physically active. \\nPhysical Activity Intensity \\nThe Guidelines consider the intensity with which people do physical activity. Some activities are a higher \\nintensity than others because they require more energy to do. For example, a person expends more energy \\nwalking briskly than slowly strolling. \\nAbsolute rates of energy expenditure during physical activity are commonly described as light, moderate, or \\nvigorous intensity. Energy expenditure is expressed by multiples of the metabolic equivalent of task (MET), \\nwhere 1 MET is the rate of energy expenditure while sitting at rest.\\n  \\n• Light-intensity activity is non-sedentary waking \\nbehavior (see sidebar) that requires less than 3.0 \\nMETs; examples include walking at a slow or leisurely \\npace (2 mph or less), cooking activities, or light \\nhousehold chores.\\n  \\n• Moderate-intensity activity requires 3.0 to less than \\n6.0 METs; examples include walking briskly (2.5 to 4 \\nmph), playing doubles tennis, or raking the yard.\\n  \\n• Vigorous-intensity activity requires 6.0 or more METs; examples include jogging, running, carrying \\nheavy groceries or other loads upstairs, shoveling snow, or participating in a strenuous fitness class. \\nMany adults do no vigorous-intensity physical activity. \\nLevels of Physical Activity  \\nThroughout the Guidelines, reference is made to four levels  \\nof aerobic physical activity: inactive, insufficiently active, \\nactive, and highly active. This classification for adults is useful \\nbecause these categories are related to how much health \\nbenefit a person obtains at a given level and how to become \\nmore active. The focus on aerobic physical activity for the \\nlevels should not be interpreted to suggest that other types of \\nactivity, such as muscle strengthening, are less important.\\n  \\n• Inactive is not getting any moderate- or vigorous-\\nintensity physical activity beyond basic movement \\nfrom daily life activities.\\nLearn More \\nAppendix 1 provides a detailed \\nexplanation of MET-minutes, a unit \\nuseful for describing the energy \\nexpenditure of a specific physical activity.'),\n",

This level exceeds the key guideline target range for adults. \\nThe Relationship Between Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activity \\nResearch on the health effects of sedentary behavior is  \\na relatively new area. Therefore, it was not addressed  \\nin 2008. Sedentary behavior has received an increasing \\namount of attention as a public health problem because \\nit appears to have health risks, and it is a highly prevalent \\nbehavior in the U.S. population. Data collected by devices  \\nin the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination  \\nSurvey (NHANES) indicate that children and adults spend \\napproximately 7.7 hours per day (55% of their monitored \\nwaking time) being sedentary. Thus, the potential population \\nhealth impact of sedentary behavior is substantial. \\nThe 2018 Advisory Committee found a strong relationship \\nbetween time in sedentary behavior and the risk of all-cause \\nmortality and cardiovascular disease mortality in adults. \\nHowever, the literature was insufficient to recommend a \\nspecific target for adults or youth for how many times during  \\nthe day sedentary time should be interrupted with physical \\nactivity. Furthermore, a specific healthy target for total \\nsedentary behavior time could not be determined. This was \\nbecause the risk related to sedentary behavior was dependent \\nupon the amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity \\nperformed. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 1-3. \\nThe figure shows moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in \\nminutes on the horizontal axis and daily sitting time in hours on the vertical axis. Red represents higher risk \\nof all-cause mortality, and green represents lower risk of all-cause mortality. Orange and yellow represent \\ntransitional decreases in risk of all-cause mortality. \\nIn general, sedentary behavior refers \\nto any waking behavior characterized \\nby a low level of energy expenditure \\n(less than or equal to 1.5 METs) \\nwhile sitting, reclining, or lying. \\nThe Guidelines operationalizes the \\ndefinition of sedentary behavior to \\ninclude self-reported sitting (leisure-\\ntime, occupational, and total), \\ntelevision (TV) viewing or screen time, \\nand low levels of movement measured \\nby devices that assess movement or \\nposture. Standing is another activity \\nwith low energy expenditure, but it is \\ndistinct from sedentary behavior in  \\nhow it affects health.\\nWhat Is Sedentary \\nBehavior?'),\n",

At the greatest volume of \\nmoderate-to-vigorous physical activity, the risk is low even for those who sit the most (upper right corner). \\nThe best currently available estimate of this volume is about 60 to 75 minutes per day of moderate-intensity \\nactivities, or 30 to 40 minutes per day of vigorous-intensity activities.

Therefore, the Guidelines takes a lifespan approach \\nand provides recommendations for three broad age groups—children and adolescents, adults, and older adults. \\nThe 2008 Guidelines provided recommendations for children, adolescents, and adults, covering individuals \\nages 6 years and older.

The intensities most often studied are \\nmoderate (equivalent in effort to brisk walking) and vigorous (equivalent in effort to running or jogging); \\n  \\n• Frequency, or how often a person does aerobic activity; and\\n  \\n• Duration, or how long a person does an activity in any one session. \\nAlthough these components make up an aerobic physical activity profile, research has shown that the total \\namount of physical activity (minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity in a week, for example) is more \\nimportant for achieving health benefits than is any one component (frequency, intensity, or duration). All time \\nspent in moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity counts toward meeting the key guidelines. \\nMuscle-Strengthening Activity \\nThis kind of activity, which includes resistance training and weight lifting, causes the body’s muscles to work \\nor hold against an applied force or weight. These activities often involve lifting relatively heavy objects, such as \\nweights, multiple times to strengthen various muscle groups. Muscle-strengthening activity can also be done \\nby using elastic bands or body weight for resistance (climbing a tree or doing push-ups, for example). \\nMuscle-strengthening activity has three components:\\n  \\n• Intensity, or how much weight or force is used relative to how much a person is able to lift;\\n  \\n• Frequency, or how often a person does muscle-strengthening activity; and\\n  \\n• Sets and repetitions, or how many times a person does the muscle-strengthening activity, like lifting  \\na weight or doing a push-up (comparable to duration for aerobic activity). \\nThe effects of muscle-strengthening activity are limited to the muscles doing the work. It is important to  \\nwork all the major muscle groups of the body—the legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms. \\nBone-Strengthening Activity \\nThis kind of activity (sometimes called weight-bearing or weight-loading activity) produces a force on the  \\nbones of the body that promotes bone growth and strength. This force is commonly produced by impact  \\nwith the ground. Examples of bone-strengthening activity include jumping jacks, running, brisk walking,  \\nand weight-lifting exercises. As these examples illustrate, bone-strengthening activities can also be  \\naerobic and muscle strengthening. \\nBalance Activities \\nThese kinds of activities can improve the ability to resist forces within or outside of the body that cause falls \\nwhile a person is stationary or moving. Walking backward, standing on one leg, or using a wobble board are \\nexamples of balance activities. Strengthening muscles of the back, abdomen, and legs also improves balance. \\nFlexibility Activities \\nThese kinds of activities enhance the ability of a joint to move through the full range of motion. Stretching \\nexercises are effective in increasing flexibility, and thereby can allow people to more easily do activities that \\nrequire greater flexibility.'),\n",

Physical Activity and Health      33 \\nThe Role of Fitness in Health \\nPhysical fitness is an important factor in the ability of people to perform routine daily activities and an \\nimportant issue from a public health perspective. Physical fitness has been defined as “the ability to carry  \\nout daily tasks with vigor and alertness, without undue fatigue, and with ample energy to enjoy leisure-time \\npursuits and respond to emergencies.” \\nPhysical fitness has multiple components, including cardiorespiratory fitness (endurance or aerobic power), \\nmusculoskeletal fitness, flexibility, balance, and speed of movement (see Table 2-2). \\nTable 2-2. Components of Physical Fitness \\nCardiorespiratory \\nFitness \\nThe ability to perform large-muscle, whole-body exercise at moderate-to-vigorous \\nintensities for extended periods of time. \\nMusculoskeletal \\nFitness \\nThe integrated function of muscle strength, muscle endurance, and muscle power to \\nenable performance of work. \\nFlexibility\\nThe range of motion available at a joint or group of joints. \\nBalance\\nThe ability to maintain equilibrium while moving or while stationary. \\nSpeed\\nThe ability to move the body quickly. \\nA substantial body of research has examined the relationship between physical fitness—cardiorespiratory \\nfitness and, in some cases, musculoskeletal fitness—and health outcomes. The findings show that greater \\nphysical fitness is associated with reduced all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality and \\nreduced risk of developing a wide range of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. To \\ndate, most studies were done in men, but new data indicate these relationships also exist in women. \\nPhysical activity and physical fitness are related to each other, and both provide important health benefits. \\nIncreases in the amount and intensity of physical activity typically produce increases in physical fitness, \\nparticularly in those who are less physically active. The available evidence suggests that physical activity  \\nand physical fitness interact in their effects on a variety of health outcomes. \\nSome possible ways that fitness and health outcomes may relate to physical activity are:\\n• Physical activity leads to improvements in physical fitness, and physical fitness causes improvements\\nin health outcomes;\\n• Physical fitness may modify the amount of the effect that physical activity has on health outcomes; or\\n• Physical activity can lead to improved physical fitness as a health outcome.'),\n",

This includes the leading \\ncauses of death, such as heart disease and some cancers, as well as other causes of death. This effect is \\nremarkable in two ways: \\n• First, only a few lifestyle choices have as large an effect on mortality as physical activity. It has been\\nestimated that people who are physically active for approximately 150 minutes a week have a\\n33 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality than those who are not physically active.\\n• Second, it is not necessary to do large amounts of activity or vigorous-intensity activity to reduce the risk\\nof all-cause mortality. Benefits start to accumulate with any amount of moderate- or vigorous-intensity\\nphysical activity.\\nResearch clearly demonstrates the importance of avoiding inactivity. Even low amounts of moderate-to-vigorous \\nintensity physical activity reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. As Figure 2-1 shows, a large benefit occurs when \\na person moves from being inactive to being insufficiently active. The relative risk of all-cause mortality continues \\nto decline as people become even more physically active. Even at very high levels of physical activity (3 to 5 times \\nthe key guidelines), there is no evidence of increased risk. \\nOverload is the physical stress placed on the body when physical activity is greater in amount or \\nintensity than usual. The body’s structures and functions respond and adapt to these stresses. For \\nexample, aerobic physical activity places a stress on the cardiorespiratory system and muscles, requiring \\nthe lungs to move more air and the heart to pump more blood and deliver it to the working muscles. This \\nincrease in demand increases the efficiency and capacity of the lungs, heart, circulatory system, and \\nexercising muscles. In the same way, muscle-strengthening and bone-strengthening activities overload \\nmuscles and bones, making them stronger. \\nProgression is closely tied to overload. Once a person reaches a certain fitness level, he or she is able to \\nprogress to higher levels of physical activity by continued overload and adaptation. Small, progressive \\nchanges in overload help the body adapt to the additional stresses while minimizing the risk of injury. \\nSpecificity means that the benefits of physical activity are specific to the body systems that are doing \\nthe work. For example, the physiologic benefits of walking are largely specific to the lower body and the \\ncardiovascular system. Push-ups primarily benefit the muscles of the chest, shoulders, and upper arms. \\nThe Beneficial Effects of Increasing Physical Activity: \\nIt Is About Overload, Progression, and Specificity'),\n",

Adults who regularly \\nengage in aerobic activity of at least moderate intensity have a significantly lower risk of developing type 2 \\ndiabetes than do inactive adults. These benefits begin to accrue at levels of physical activity below the key \\nguideline of 150 to 300 minutes a week, and additional amounts of moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical \\nactivity seem to lower risk even further. Insulin sensitivity can be improved with just a single bout of physical \\nactivity. In addition, physical activity helps control blood glucose in people who already have type 2 diabetes. \\nPhysical activity improves cardiometabolic health in children and adolescents, as well as in adults.

Physical Activity and Health      37 \\nWeight Management \\nPhysical activity and caloric intake both must be considered when trying to control body weight. Because of its \\nrole in energy balance, physical activity is a critical factor in determining whether a person can maintain a \\nhealthy body weight, lose excess body weight, or maintain successful weight loss. \\nStrong scientific evidence shows that physical activity helps people maintain a stable weight over time and \\ncan reduce the risk of excessive weight gain and the incidence of obesity. People vary a great deal in how much \\nphysical activity they need to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Some need more physical activity than \\nothers to maintain a healthy body weight, to lose weight, or to keep weight off once it has been lost. Many people \\nneed more than the equivalent of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week to maintain their weight. The \\nrelationship between physical activity and prevention of weight gain is most often observed with moderate- or \\nvigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity. Muscle-strengthening activities help promote weight maintenance, \\nalthough not to the same degree as aerobic activity. \\nPeople who want to lose a substantial amount of weight (more than 5 percent of body weight) and people \\nwho are trying to keep a significant amount of weight off once it has been lost may need to do more than 300 \\nminutes of moderate-intensity activity a week to meet weight-control goals. Muscle-strengthening activities can \\nalso help maintain lean body mass during weight loss. Combining both caloric restriction and physical activity \\ntend to be most beneficial for weight loss rather than just caloric restriction or just physical activity. \\nPeople with overweight or obesity tend to experience the same benefits of physical activity as those with \\nnormal weight. However, there are specific exceptions. Compared to women with normal weight, women with \\noverweight or obesity see a greater risk reduction for developing endometrial cancer and a greater risk reduction \\nof breast cancer-specific mortality as a result of being more physically active. \\nRegular physical activity also helps control body weight or reduce body fat in children and adolescents ages 3 \\nthrough 17 years. Throughout childhood and adolescence, higher levels of physical activity are associated with \\nsmaller increases in body weight and adiposity. \\nMost of the benefits of physical activity have been studied with moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic \\nactivity. Recent research has examined high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which may provide similar \\nreductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors as those observed with continuous moderate-\\nintensity physical activity. HIIT is a form of interval training that consists of alternating short periods \\nof maximal-effort exercise with less intense recovery periods.

Healthy bones, joints, and muscles are critical \\nto the ability to do daily activities without physical limitations such as climbing stairs, working in the garden,  \\nor carrying a small child. \\nProgressive muscle-strengthening activities preserve or increase muscle mass, strength, and power. Greater \\namounts (through higher frequency, heavier weights, or more resistance) improve muscle function to a greater \\ndegree. Improvements occur in children and adolescents as well as in younger and older adults. Resistance \\nexercises also improve muscular strength in persons with conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, cerebral \\npalsy, and spinal cord injury. Though aerobic activity does not increase muscle mass in the same way that muscle-\\nstrengthening activities do, it may also help slow the loss of muscle with aging. \\nPreserving bone, joint, and muscle health is essential with increasing age. Studies show that the frequent \\ndecline in bone density that happens during aging can be slowed with regular physical activity. These effects \\nare seen in people who participate in aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and bone-strengthening physical activity \\nprograms of moderate or vigorous intensity. The range of total physical activity for these benefits varies widely. \\nImportant changes seem to begin at 90 minutes a week. \\nBuilding strong, healthy bones is also important for children and adolescents. Along with having a healthy diet \\nthat includes adequate calcium and vitamin D, physical activity is critical for bone development in youth. Children \\nand adolescents ages 3 through 17 years who are physically active (such as by running, jumping, and doing other \\nbone-strengthening activities) have higher bone mass, improved bone structure, and greater bone strength. \\nRegular physical activity also helps people with osteoarthritis or other rheumatic conditions affecting the joints. \\nParticipation in 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity plus muscle-strengthening \\nactivity improves pain management, function, and quality of life. Up to 10,000 steps per day does not appear to \\nworsen the progression of osteoarthritis. Very high levels of physical activity, however, may have extra risks. People \\nwho participate in very high levels of high-impact physical activity—such as elite or professional athletes—have a \\nhigher risk of hip and knee osteoarthritis, mostly due to the risk of injury involved in competing in some sports. \\nFunctional Ability and Fall Prevention \\nPhysical function, or functional ability, is the capacity of a person to perform tasks or behaviors that enable him \\nor her to carry out everyday activities, such as climbing stairs, or to fulfill basic life roles, such as personal care, \\ngrocery shopping, or playing with grandchildren. Loss of functional ability is referred to as functional limitation. \\nMiddle-aged and older adults who are physically active have lower risk of functional limitations than do inactive \\nadults. Physical activity can prevent or delay the onset of substantial functional or role limitations. Older adults \\nwho already have functional limitations also benefit from regular physical activity. \\nHip fracture is a serious health condition that can have life-changing negative effects for many older people. \\nPhysically active people, especially women, appear to have a lower risk of hip fracture than do inactive people. \\nAmong older adults, physical activity reduces the risk of falling and injuries from falls. Research demonstrates \\nthat multicomponent physical activity programs are most successful at reducing falls and injuries. These \\nprograms commonly include muscle-strengthening activities and balance training and may also include gait \\nand coordination training, physical function training, and moderate-intensity activities, such as walking. It is \\nimportant to note that doing only low-intensity walking does not seem to reduce the risk of fall-related injuries'),\n",

As \\nchildren become adolescents, they typically reduce their physical activity, making it all the more important for \\nadults to provide age-appropriate, enjoyable opportunities for physical activity and to encourage youth to \\nparticipate. \\nKey Guidelines for School-Aged Children and Adolescents \\nIt is important to provide young people opportunities and encouragement to participate  \\nin physical activities that are appropriate for their age, that are enjoyable, and that  \\noffer variety. \\nChildren and adolescents ages 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes (1 hour) or  \\nmore of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily: \\n  \\n• Aerobic: Most of the 60 minutes or more per day should be either moderate- or \\nvigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity and should include vigorous-intensity \\nphysical activity on at least 3 days a week. \\n  \\n• Muscle-strengthening: As part of their 60 minutes or more of daily physical \\nactivity, children and adolescents should include muscle-strengthening physical \\nactivity on at least 3 days a week. \\n  \\n• Bone-strengthening: As part of their 60 minutes or more of daily physical activity, \\nchildren and adolescents should include bone-strengthening physical activity on at \\nleast 3 days a week.'),\n",

Active Children and Adolescents      49 \\nExplaining the Guidelines \\nTypes of Activity \\nThe key guidelines for school-aged children and adolescents focus on three types of activity—aerobic, muscle \\nstrengthening, and bone strengthening. Each has important health benefits. Certain activities can be aerobic as \\nwell as muscle or bone strengthening. Illustrations of these activities can be found in the real-life examples at \\nthe end of this chapter. \\nAerobic activities are those in which young people rhythmically move their large muscles for a sustained \\nperiod of time. Running, hopping, skipping, jumping rope, swimming, dancing, and bicycling are all examples \\nof aerobic activities. Aerobic activities increase cardiorespiratory fitness. Children often do activities in short \\nbursts, which may not technically be aerobic. However, the Guidelines uses the term aerobic to refer to these \\ntypes of activities, even if they are done only briefly. \\nMuscle-strengthening activities make muscles do more work \\nthan usual during activities of daily life. This is called overload, \\nand strengthens the muscles. Muscle-strengthening activities \\ncan be unstructured and part of play, such as playing on \\nplayground equipment, climbing trees, and playing tug-of-war. \\nOr they can be structured, such as lifting weights or working \\nwith resistance bands. \\nBone-strengthening activities produce a force on the bones of the body that promotes bone growth and \\nstrength. This force is commonly produced by impact with the ground. Running, jumping rope, basketball, \\ntennis, and hopscotch are all examples of bone-strengthening activities. As these examples illustrate, bone-\\nstrengthening activities can also be aerobic and muscle strengthening. \\nHow Age Influences Physical Activity in Children and Adolescents \\nChildren and adolescents should meet the key guidelines by doing activity that is appropriate for their age. \\nTheir natural patterns of movement differ from those of adults. For example, children are naturally active in an \\nintermittent way, particularly when they do unstructured active play. During recess and in their free play and \\ngames, children use basic aerobic and bone-strengthening activities, such as running, hopping, skipping, and \\njumping, to develop movement patterns and skills. They alternate brief periods of moderate- and vigorous-\\nintensity activity with periods of light-intensity physical activity or rest. Any episode of moderate- or vigorous-\\nintensity physical activity, however brief, counts toward the key guidelines for children and adolescents ages 6 \\nthrough 17 years. For preschool-aged children, activity of any intensity counts, including light intensity. \\nChildren also commonly increase muscle strength through unstructured activities that involve lifting or \\nmoving their body weight or working against resistance. Children do not usually do or need formal muscle-\\nstrengthening programs, such as lifting weights. However, these programs are safe for children if they are \\nproperly prescribed and supervised.\\nLearn More \\nSee Chapter 2. Physical Activity \\nand Health for more on overload and \\nrelated concepts.'),\n",

They are able to play organized \\ngames and sports and are able to sustain longer periods of activity. But they still commonly do intermittent \\nactivity, and any period of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activity can count toward the key guidelines. \\nDuring the transition to adolescence, sex differences in physical activity behavior appear. The amount of \\nphysical activity done by girls tends to decrease dramatically compared to that of boys, and the disparity \\npersists into adulthood (Figures 1-1 and 1-2). Therefore, adolescent girls may need additional support and \\nencouragement to maintain health-enhancing physical activity. \\nAdolescents may meet the key guidelines by doing free play, sports, or structured programs. Structured \\nexercise programs can include muscle-strengthening activities, such as lifting weights, working with resistance \\nbands, or using body weight for resistance (such as push-ups, pull-ups, and planks). Muscle-strengthening \\nactivities count if they involve a moderate or greater level of effort and work the major muscle groups of the \\nbody—legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms. \\nLevels of Intensity for Aerobic Activity \\nChildren and adolescents ages 6 and older can meet the key guidelines by doing a combination of moderate- \\nand vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activities or by doing only vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activities. \\nYouth should not do only moderate-intensity activity. It is important to include vigorous-intensity activities \\nbecause they lead to greater improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness. \\nThe intensity of aerobic physical activity can be defined on either an absolute or a relative scale. Either scale \\ncan be used to monitor the intensity of aerobic physical activity: \\nAbsolute intensity is the amount of energy expended during the activity, without considering a person’s \\ncardiorespiratory fitness. \\nRelative intensity uses a person’s level of cardiorespiratory fitness to assess level of effort. \\nRelative intensity describes a person’s level of effort relative \\nto his or her fitness. As a rule of thumb, on a scale of 0 to 10, \\nwhere sitting is 0 and the highest level of effort possible is 10, \\nmoderate-intensity activity is a 5 or 6. Young people doing \\nmoderate-intensity activity will notice that their hearts are \\nbeating faster than normal and they are breathing harder than \\nnormal. Vigorous-intensity activity begins at a level of 7 or \\n8. Youth doing vigorous-intensity activity will feel their heart \\nbeating much faster than normal, and they will breathe much \\nharder than normal. \\nWhen adults supervise children, they generally cannot ascertain a child’s heart or breathing rate. However, \\nthey can observe whether a child is doing an activity which, based upon absolute energy expenditure, \\nis considered to be either moderate or vigorous intensity. For example, a child walking to school is doing \\nLearn More \\nSee Appendix 1.

Some physical activity is better \\nthan none. Adults who sit less and do any amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity \\ngain some health benefits. \\nFor substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 \\nminutes) to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes (1 hour and \\n15 minutes) to 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic \\nphysical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic \\nactivity. Preferably, aerobic activity should be spread throughout the week. \\nAdditional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond the equivalent \\nof 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity a week. \\nAdults should also do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity and \\nthat involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide \\nadditional health benefits. \\nAdults who are physically active are healthier, feel better, \\nand are less likely to develop many chronic diseases, such as \\ncardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and several types of \\ncancer than are adults who are inactive. Regular moderate-to-\\nvigorous physical activity also reduces feelings of anxiety and \\ndepression and improves sleep and quality of life. Even a single \\nepisode of physical activity provides temporary improvements \\nin cognitive function and state anxiety. Adults who are more \\nphysically active are better able to perform everyday tasks \\nwithout undue fatigue. Increased amounts of moderate-to-\\nvigorous physical activity are associated with improved cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, including a \\nhealthier body weight and body composition. Adults who are more physically active can more easily carry out \\ndaily tasks like climbing stairs, carrying heavy packages, and performing household chores. These benefits are \\ntrue for men and women of all ages, races, and ethnicities. \\nAdults gain most of these health benefits when they do the equivalent of 150 to 300 minutes (2 hours and 30 \\nminutes to 5 hours) of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity each week. Adults gain additional and more \\nextensive health benefits with even more physical activity. Muscle-strengthening activities also provide health \\nbenefits and are an important part of an adult’s overall physical activity plan.

Active Adults      57 \\nExplaining the Key Guidelines \\nThe key guidelines for adults focus on two types of activity— \\naerobic and muscle strengthening. Each provides important \\nhealth benefits, as explained in Chapter 2. Physical Activity \\nand Health. \\nAerobic Activity \\nAerobic activities, also called endurance or cardio activities, \\nare physical activities in which people move their large \\nmuscles in a rhythmic manner for a sustained period of \\ntime. Running, brisk walking, bicycling, playing basketball, \\ndancing, and swimming are all examples of aerobic activities. \\nAerobic activity makes a person’s heart beat more rapidly and \\nbreathing rate increase to meet the demands of the body’s \\nmovement. Over time, regular aerobic activity makes the \\ncardiorespiratory system stronger and more fit. \\nThe purpose of aerobic activity does not affect whether or \\nnot it counts toward meeting the key guidelines. For example, \\nphysically active occupations can count toward meeting the \\nkey guidelines, as can active transportation choices (walking \\nor bicycling). All types of aerobic activities can count as long \\nas they are of sufficient intensity. For health benefits, the total \\namount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is more \\nimportant than the length of each physical activity episode. \\nHow Much Total Activity a Week? \\nWhen adults do the equivalent of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, \\nthe benefits are substantial. These benefits include lower risk of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, \\nstroke, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, anxiety, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease and other \\ndementias. Physically active adults also sleep better, have improved cognition, and have better quality of life. \\nAs a person moves from 150 minutes a week toward 300 minutes a week, the health benefits become more \\nextensive. For example, a person who does 300 minutes a week has an even lower risk of heart disease or type \\n2 diabetes than a person who does 150 minutes a week. \\nFurthermore, adults who are regularly active at or near the higher end of the key guideline range—300 minutes \\na week—gain additional health benefits.

Research studies consistently show \\nthat activity performed on at least 3 days a week produces \\nhealth benefits. Spreading physical activity across at least \\n3 days a week may also help reduce the risk of injury and \\nprevent excessive fatigue. \\nAll amounts of aerobic activity count toward meeting \\nthe key guidelines if they are performed at moderate or \\nvigorous intensity. Episodes of physical activity can be \\ndivided throughout the day or week, depending on personal \\npreference. \\nHow Intense? \\nThe key guidelines for adults focus on two levels of \\nintensity—moderate and vigorous. To meet the key \\nguidelines, adults can do either moderate-intensity or \\nvigorous-intensity aerobic activities, or a combination \\nof both. It takes less time to get the same benefit from \\nvigorous-intensity activities than from moderate-intensity \\nactivities. A general rule of thumb is that 2 minutes of moderate-intensity activity counts the same as 1 minute \\nof vigorous-intensity activity. For example, 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity is roughly the same as 15 \\nminutes of vigorous-intensity activity. \\nThe intensity of aerobic activity can be tracked in two ways—absolute intensity and relative intensity. \\nAbsolute intensity is the amount of energy expended during the activity, without considering a person’s \\ncardiorespiratory fitness. The energy expenditure of light-intensity activity is 1.6 to 2.9 times the amount of \\nenergy expended when a person is at rest. Moderate-intensity activities expend 3.0 to 5.9 times the amount  \\nof energy expended at rest. The energy expenditure of vigorous-intensity activities is 6.0 or more times the \\nenergy expended at rest. \\nRelative intensity is the level of effort required to do an \\nactivity. Less fit people generally require a higher level of effort \\nthan more fit people to do the same activity. Relative intensity \\ncan be estimated using a scale of 0 to 10, where sitting is \\n0 and the highest level of effort possible is 10. Moderate-\\nintensity activity is a 5 or 6. Vigorous-intensity activity begins \\nat a level of 7 or 8. \\nPeople who sit a lot have an \\nincreased risk of all-cause and \\ncardiovascular disease mortality, as \\nwell as an increased risk of developing \\ncardiovascular disease, type 2 \\ndiabetes, and colon, endometrial, and \\nlung cancers. The mortality risk related \\nto sitting is not observed among people \\nwho do 60 to 75 minutes of moderate-\\nintensity physical activity a day, but \\nthis amount of activity is far more than \\nmost people obtain. Therefore, both \\nreducing sitting time and increasing \\nphysical activity will provide benefits. \\nOffsetting the \\nRisks of Too  \\nMuch Sitting \\nLearn More \\nSee Appendix 1.

Active Adults      61 \\nMuscle-Strengthening Activity \\nMuscle-strengthening activities provide additional benefits \\nnot found with aerobic activity. The benefits of muscle-\\nstrengthening activity include increased bone strength and \\nmuscular fitness. Muscle-strengthening activities can also \\nhelp maintain muscle mass during weight loss. \\nMuscle-strengthening activities make muscles do more work \\nthan they are accustomed to doing. That is, they overload \\nthe muscles. Examples of muscle-strengthening activities \\ninclude lifting weights, working with resistance bands, doing \\ncalisthenics that use body weight for resistance (such as \\npush-ups, pull-ups, and planks), carrying heavy loads, and \\nheavy gardening. \\nMuscle-strengthening activities count if they involve a \\nmoderate or greater level of intensity or effort and work \\nthe major muscle groups of the body—the legs, hips, back, \\nchest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms. Muscle-strengthening \\nactivities for all the major muscle groups should be done at least 2 days a week. The improvement in, or \\nmaintenance of, muscle strength is specific to the muscles used during the activity, so a variety of activities is \\nnecessary to achieve balanced muscle strength. \\nNo specific amount of time is recommended for muscle strengthening, but muscle-strengthening exercises \\nshould be performed to the point at which it would be difficult to do another repetition. When resistance \\ntraining is used to enhance muscle strength, one set of 8 to 12 repetitions of each exercise is effective, although \\n2 or 3 sets may be more effective. Improvements in muscle strength and endurance are progressive over time. \\nIncreases in the amount of weight or the days a week of exercising will result in stronger muscles. \\nFlexibility Activities \\nFlexibility is an important part of physical fitness. Some types \\nof physical activity, such as ballet or salsa dancing, require \\nmore flexibility than others. Flexibility activities enhance the \\nability of a joint to move through the full range of motion. \\nStretching exercises are effective in increasing flexibility, and \\nthereby can allow people to more easily do activities that \\nrequire greater flexibility. For these reasons, flexibility activities \\nare an appropriate part of a physical activity program, even \\nthough their health benefits are unknown and it is unclear \\nwhether they reduce risk of injury. Time spent doing flexibility \\nactivities by themselves does not count toward meeting the \\naerobic or muscle-strengthening key guidelines.'),\n",

Commonly, the warm-up \\nand cool-down involve doing an activity at a slower speed or \\nlower intensity. A warm-up before moderate- or vigorous-\\nintensity aerobic activity allows a gradual increase in heart \\nrate and breathing at the start of the episode of activity. A \\ncool-down after activity allows a gradual decrease at the end \\nof the episode. Time spent doing warm-up and cool-down \\nmay count toward meeting the aerobic key guidelines if the \\nactivity is at least moderate intensity (for example, walking \\nbriskly as a warm-up before jogging). A warm-up for muscle-\\nstrengthening activity commonly involves doing exercises \\nwith lighter weight. \\nMeeting the Key Guidelines \\nAdults have many options for becoming physically active, increasing their physical activity, and staying active \\nthroughout their lives. In all cases, adults should try to move more and sit less each day. In deciding how to \\nmeet the key guidelines, adults should think about how much physical activity they are already doing and how \\nphysically fit they are. Personal health and fitness goals are also important to consider. Examples of how to \\nmeet the key guidelines are provided later in this chapter. \\nIn general, healthy men and women who plan gradual increases in their weekly amounts of physical activity do not \\nneed to consult a health care provider before becoming physically active. Women who are pregnant and adults \\nwith chronic conditions or disabilities are discussed in Chapter 6. Additional Considerations for Some Adults. \\nInactive or Insufficiently Active Adults \\nAdults who do not yet do the equivalent of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week (inactive or \\ninsufficiently active) should work gradually toward this goal. The initial amount of activity should be at a light or \\nmoderate intensity, for short periods of time, with the sessions spread throughout the week. People likely gain \\nsome health benefits even when they replace sitting time with light-intensity activity. Sitting less and doing \\nmoderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity has even more benefits. The good news is that “some is better \\nthan none.” As shown in Figure 2-1, which plots the benefits of increasing physical activity on all-cause mortality, \\nthe biggest gain in benefits occurs when going from no physical activity to being active for just 60 minutes a week. \\nTo reduce risk of injury, it is important to increase the amount \\nof physical activity gradually over a period of weeks to months. \\nFor example, an inactive person could start with a walking \\nprogram consisting of 5 minutes of walking several times each \\nday, 5 to 6 days a week. The length of time could then gradually \\nbe increased to 10 minutes per session, 3 times a day, and the \\nwalking speed could be increased slowly. \\nLearn More \\nSee Chapter 7.

Physical activity, along with appropriate dietary intake, is an important part of \\nmaintaining a healthy weight because it helps in preventing weight gain, losing weight, and keeping extra weight \\noff once it has been lost. Physical activity also helps reduce abdominal fat and preserve muscle during weight \\nloss. Adults should aim for a healthy, stable body weight.

Active Older Adults      67 \\nThe benefits of regular physical activity occur throughout life and are essential for healthy aging. Adults ages \\n65 years and older gain substantial health benefits from regular physical activity. However, it is never too \\nlate to start being physically active. Being physically active makes it easier to perform activities of daily living, \\nincluding eating, bathing, toileting, dressing, getting into or out of a bed or chair, and moving around the house  \\nor neighborhood. Physically active older adults are less likely to experience falls, and if they do fall, they are \\nless likely to be seriously injured. Physical activity can also preserve physical function and mobility, which may \\nhelp maintain independence longer and delay the onset of major disability. Research shows that physical \\nactivity can improve physical function in adults of any age, adults with overweight or obesity, and even \\nthose who are frail. Promoting physical activity and reducing sedentary behavior for older adults is especially \\nimportant because this population is the least physically active of any age group, and most older adults spend \\na significant proportion of their day being sedentary. \\nOlder adults are a varied group. Most, but not all, have \\none or more chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, \\ncardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, or cancer, and these \\nconditions vary in type and severity. Nevertheless, being \\nphysically active has significant benefits for all older adults. \\nPhysical activity is key to preventing and managing chronic \\ndisease. Other benefits include a lower risk of dementia, \\nbetter perceived quality of life, and reduced symptoms of \\nanxiety and depression. Additionally, doing physical activity with others can provide opportunities for social \\nengagement and interaction. All older adults experience a loss of physical fitness and function with age, but \\nsome experience this more than others. This diversity means that some older adults can run several miles, \\nwhile others struggle to walk a few blocks. \\nThis chapter provides guidance about physical activity for adults ages 65 years and older. The Guidelines seeks \\nto help older adults select the types and amounts of physical activity appropriate for their own abilities. \\nFor adults ages 65 years and older who have good fitness and no chronic conditions, the guidance in this \\nchapter is essentially the same as that provided in Chapter 4. Active Adults.\\nLearn More \\nSee Chapter 6. Additional \\nConsiderations for Some Adults for a \\ndiscussion of physical activity for older \\nadults with chronic conditions.'),\n",

Active Older Adults      69 \\nExplaining the Key Guidelines \\nAs with other adults, the key guidelines for older adults focus mainly on two types of activity—aerobic and \\nmuscle-strengthening. In addition, these key guidelines discuss the importance of multicomponent physical \\nactivity, which includes balance training along with aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity. Each provides \\nimportant health benefits, especially to improve physical function, as explained in Chapter 2. Physical Activity \\nand Health. \\nAerobic Activity \\nAerobic activities, also called endurance or cardio activities, are physical activities in which people move their \\nlarge muscles in a rhythmic manner for a sustained period of time. Brisk walking, jogging, biking, dancing, and \\nswimming are all examples of aerobic activities. Aerobic activity makes a person’s heart beat more rapidly \\nand breathing rate increase to meet the demands of the body’s movement. Over time, regular aerobic activity \\nmakes the cardiorespiratory system stronger and more fit. \\nNo matter what the purpose—from walking the dog, to taking a dance or exercise class, to bicycling to the \\nstore—all types of aerobic activity count toward meeting the key guidelines. When putting the key guidelines \\ninto action, it is important to consider the total amount of activity, how often, and at what intensity. For health \\nbenefits, the total amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is more important than the length of each \\nphysical activity episode. In general, muscle-strengthening activities do not count toward meeting the aerobic \\nkey guidelines. Table 5-1 lists some examples of aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities for older adults. \\nHow Much Total Activity a Week? \\nOlder adults should aim to do at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week, or an \\nequivalent amount (75 to 150 minutes) of vigorous-intensity activity. They can also do an equivalent amount of \\nactivity by doing both moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. As is true for people of all other ages, greater \\namounts of physical activity provide additional and more extensive health benefits. Older adults who do \\nmore aerobic physical activity have a reduced risk of age-related loss of function and reduced risk of physical \\nfunction limitations compared to the general aging population.'),\n",

Research studies consistently show \\nthat activity performed on at least 3 days a week produces health benefits. Spreading physical activity across \\nat least 3 days a week may help to reduce the risk of injury and prevent excessive fatigue. \\nAll amounts of aerobic activity count toward meeting the key guidelines if they are performed at moderate \\nor vigorous intensity. Episodes of physical activity can be divided throughout the day or week, depending on \\npersonal preference. \\nHow Intense? \\nThe intensity of aerobic activity can be tracked in two ways—absolute intensity and relative intensity. Most \\nstudies on older adults use relative intensity to track aerobic physical activity. \\n  \\n• Absolute intensity is the amount of energy expended during the activity without considering a person’s \\ncardiorespiratory fitness. The energy expenditure of light-intensity activity, for example, is 1.6 to 2.9 \\ntimes the amount of energy expended when a person is at rest. Moderate-intensity activities expend \\n3.0 to 5.9 times the amount of energy expended at rest. The energy expenditure of vigorous-intensity \\nactivities is 6.0 or more times the energy expended at rest. \\n  \\n• Relative intensity is the level of effort required to do an activity. Less fit people generally require a \\nhigher level of effort than more fit people to do the same activity. Relative intensity can be estimated \\nusing a scale of 0 to 10, where sitting is 0 and the highest \\nlevel of effort possible is 10. \\nWhen using relative intensity, people pay attention to how \\nphysical activity affects their heart rate and breathing. As \\na rule of thumb, a person doing moderate-intensity aerobic \\nactivity can talk, but not sing, during the activity. A person \\ndoing vigorous-intensity activity cannot say more than a few \\nwords without pausing for a breath. \\nEither absolute or relative intensity can be used to monitor \\nprogress in meeting the key guidelines. Because older  \\nadults expend more energy than younger adults for the same \\ntask, such as walking, and because aerobic capacity declines \\nwith age, relative intensity is a better guide for older adults \\nthan absolute intensity. Certain activities, such as some types \\nof yoga or tai chi, that are considered light-intensity on an absolute scale for younger adults may be perceived \\nas moderate or vigorous intensity for older adults. People who have been very inactive and are working to \\nincrease their physical activity levels can also use relative intensity to help determine their level of effort. \\nOlder adults can meet the key guidelines by doing relatively moderate-intensity activity, relatively vigorous-\\nintensity activity, or a combination of both. The relative intensity of aerobic activity is related to a person’s  \\nlevel of cardiorespiratory fitness.'),\n",

On a scale of 0 to 10, where sitting is 0 and  \\nthe greatest effort possible is 10, moderate-intensity activity is a 5 or 6 and produces noticeable increases  \\nin breathing rate and heart rate. \\nVigorous-intensity activity begins at a level of 7 or 8 on this scale and produces large increases in a person’s \\nbreathing and heart rate. \\nA general rule of thumb is that 2 minutes of moderate-intensity activity counts the same as 1 minute of \\nvigorous-intensity activity. For example, 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity is roughly the same as 15 \\nminutes of vigorous-intensity activity. \\nMuscle-Strengthening Activities \\nAt least 2 days a week, older adults should do muscle-\\nstrengthening activities that involve all the major muscle \\ngroups. These are the muscles of the legs, hips, chest, back, \\nabdomen, shoulders, and arms. The improvements in, or \\nmaintenance of, muscular strength are specific to the \\nmuscles used during the activity, so a variety of activities is \\nnecessary to achieve balanced muscle strength. \\nMuscle-strengthening activities make muscles do more work \\nthan they are accustomed to during activities of daily life. \\nExamples of muscle-strengthening activities include lifting \\nweights, working with resistance bands, doing calisthenics \\nthat use body weight for resistance (such as push-ups, pull-\\nups, and planks), climbing stairs, shoveling snow, and carrying \\nheavy loads (such as groceries and heavy gardening). \\nMuscle-strengthening activities count if they involve a moderate or greater level of intensity or effort and work \\nthe major muscle groups of the body. Whatever the reason for doing it, any muscle-strengthening activity counts \\ntoward meeting the key guidelines. For example, muscle-strengthening activity done as part of a therapy or \\nrehabilitation program can count. \\nNo specific amount of time is recommended for muscle strengthening, but muscle-strengthening exercises \\nshould be performed to the point at which it would be difficult to do another repetition. When resistance \\ntraining is used to enhance muscle strength, one set of 8 to 12 repetitions of each exercise is effective, although \\n2 or 3 sets may be more effective.

Active Older Adults      73 \\nBalance Activities \\nThese kinds of activities can improve the ability to resist forces within or outside of the body that cause falls. \\nFall prevention programs that include balance training and other exercises to improve activities of daily \\nliving can also significantly reduce the risk of injury, such as bone fractures, if a fall does occur. Studies of fall \\nprevention programs generally include about three sessions a week. Balance training examples include walking \\nheel-to-toe, practicing standing from a sitting position, and using a wobble board. Strengthening muscles of \\nthe back, abdomen, and legs also improves balance. \\nMulticomponent Physical Activity \\nDoing multicomponent physical activities can help reduce \\nthe risk of injury from falls and improve physical function. \\nMulticomponent refers to physical activity that includes more \\nthan one type of physical activity, such as aerobic, muscle \\nstrengthening, and balance training. Multicomponent physical \\nactivity can be done at home or in a community setting as \\npart of a structured program that includes a combination of \\nbalance, muscle-strengthening, and aerobic physical activity, \\nand may include gait, coordination, and physical function \\ntraining. Recreational activities such as dancing, yoga, tai chi, \\ngardening, or sports can also be considered multicomponent \\nbecause they often incorporate multiple types of physical \\nactivity. It is appropriate and recommended that all older \\nadults do multicomponent physical activities. \\nFlexibility, Warm-Up, and Cool-Down \\nOlder adults should maintain the flexibility necessary for \\nregular physical activity and activities of daily life. Flexibility \\nactivities enhance the ability of a joint to move through the full \\nrange of motion. Stretching exercises are effective in increasing \\nflexibility, and thereby can allow people to more easily do \\nactivities that require greater flexibility. Although the health \\nbenefits of these activities alone are not known and they \\nhave not been demonstrated to reduce risk of activity-related \\ninjuries, they are an appropriate component of a physical activity program. However, time spent doing flexibility \\nactivities by themselves does not count toward meeting the aerobic or muscle-strengthening key guidelines. \\nResearch studies of effective exercise programs typically include warm-up and cool-down activities. A warm-\\nup before moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic activity allows a gradual increase in heart rate and breathing \\nat the start of the episode of activity. A cool-down after activity allows a gradual heart rate decrease at the \\nend of the session. Time spent doing warm-up and cool-down activities may count toward meeting the aerobic \\nactivity guidelines if the activity is at least moderate intensity (for example, walking briskly to warm up for a \\njog). A warm-up for muscle-strengthening activity commonly involves doing exercises with less weight. \\nWhat Is Multicomponent \\nPhysical Activity? \\nFor older adults, multicomponent \\nphysical activity is important to improve \\nphysical function and decrease the \\nrisk of falls or injury from a fall. These \\nactivities can be done at home or in a \\nstructured group setting. Many studied \\ninterventions combine all types of \\nexercise (aerobic, muscle strengthening, \\nand balance) into one session, and this \\nhas been shown to be effective. \\nAn example of a multicomponent \\nphysical activity program could include \\nwalking (aerobic activity), lifting \\nweights (muscle strengthening), and \\ncould incorporate balance by walking \\nbackwards or sideways or by standing \\non one foot while doing an upper \\nbody muscle-strengthening activity, \\nsuch as bicep curls.

Many factors \\ninfluence decisions to be active, such as personal goals, current physical activity habits, and health and safety \\nconsiderations. In all cases, older adults should try to move more and sit less each day. In working toward \\nmeeting the key guidelines, older adults are encouraged to do a variety of activities. This approach can make \\nactivity more enjoyable and may reduce the risk of overuse injury. Examples of how to meet the key guidelines \\nare provided later in this chapter. \\nHealthy older adults who plan gradual increases in their \\nweekly amounts of physical activity generally do not need to \\nconsult a health care professional before becoming physically \\nactive. However, health care professionals and physical \\nactivity specialists can help people attain and maintain regular \\nphysical activity by providing advice on appropriate types of \\nactivities and ways to progress at a safe and steady pace. \\nOlder adults with chronic conditions should talk with their health care professional to determine whether their \\nconditions limit, in any way, their ability to do regular physical activity. Such a conversation should also help \\npeople learn about appropriate types and amounts of physical activity. \\nInactive and Insufficiently Active Older Adults \\nSome physical activity is better than none. Older adults who do not yet do the equivalent of 150 minutes of \\nmoderate-intensity physical activity a week can gain health benefits by doing small amounts of physical activity. \\nIn addition, swapping out sedentary behavior, such as sitting, for light-intensity physical activity, such as light \\nhousework, may produce some benefits. There are even more benefits to sitting less and doing moderate- or \\nvigorous-intensity physical activity. As shown in Figure 2-1, which plots the benefits of increasing physical \\nactivity on all-cause mortality, the biggest gain in benefits occurs when going from no physical activity to being \\nactive for just 60 minutes a week. \\nOlder adults should increase their amount of physical activity \\ngradually. It can take months for those with low fitness to \\ngradually meet their activity goals. To reduce risk of injury, it is \\nimportant to increase the amount of physical activity gradually \\nover a period of weeks to months. For example, an inactive \\nperson could start with a walking program consisting of 5 \\nminutes of slow walking several times each day, 5 to 6 days a \\nweek. The length of time could then gradually be increased to \\n10 minutes per session, 3 times a day, and the walking speed  \\ncould be increased slowly. \\nMuscle-strengthening activities should also be gradually increased over time. Initially, these activities can be \\ndone just 1 day a week starting at a light or moderate intensity. Over time, the number of days a week can \\nbe increased to 2, and then possibly to more than 2. Each week, the intensity can be increased slightly until it \\nbecomes moderate or greater.\\nLearn More \\nSee Chapter 7.

If necessary, \\nthey should increase their weekly minutes of aerobic physical activity gradually over time and decrease caloric \\nintake to a point where they can achieve energy balance and a healthy weight. \\nSome older adults will need a higher level of physical activity to maintain a healthy body weight or prevent \\nweight regain. Some may need more than the equivalent of 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity activity. \\nIt is possible to achieve this level of activity by gradually increasing activity over time. \\nOlder adults who are capable of relatively vigorous-intensity activity and need a high level of physical activity \\nto maintain a healthy weight should consider some relatively vigorous-intensity activity as a means of weight \\ncontrol. This approach is more time-efficient than doing only moderate-intensity activity. However, high levels \\nof activity are not feasible for many older adults. These adults should achieve a level of physical activity that \\nis sustainable and safe. If further weight loss is needed, these older adults should achieve energy balance by \\nreducing caloric intake. \\nIt is important to remember that all activities, whether light, moderate, or vigorous intensity, “count” for energy \\nbalance. Active choices, such as taking the stairs rather than the elevator or adding short episodes of walking \\nto the day, are examples of activities that can be helpful in maintaining a healthy body weight.'),\n",

They \\nshould talk with their health care professional about setting \\nphysical activity goals. They should avoid an inactive lifestyle. \\nPhysical inactivity is among the strongest predictors of physical \\ndisability in older people. Even small amounts of moderate-intensity aerobic activity provide some health benefits. \\nOlder adults with frailty and those who have had a hip fracture are discussed below. \\nFrailty \\nIn frail older adults, strong evidence demonstrates that physical function can be improved with regular physical \\nactivity. Physical activity can contribute to improved walking and gait, balance, strength, self-reported measures  \\nof activities of daily living, and quality of life. Multicomponent physical activity of at least moderate intensity  \\nthat is performed 3 or more times a week for a duration of 30 to 45 minutes per session, over at least 3 to 5 \\nmonths, appears most effective to increase functional ability in frail older adults. Multicomponent physical  \\nactivity programs are more effective than doing just a single type of physical activity. \\nAfter a Hip Fracture \\nRegular physical activity can reduce the risk of falls and the extent of an injury from a fall. Physical activity is \\nalso important to improve physical function following a hip fracture.

These outings usually involve at least 20 minutes of walking. \\nStarting out: Rumi slowly adds to her walks by taking a slightly longer route. After a few weeks, she is able to \\nwalk about 15 minutes 3 times a week. She continues to go to the bird-watching group. \\nReaching her goal: Within a few months, Rumi is consistently walking the 10-minute loop around her assisted-\\nliving complex every day. She extends to a longer 15-minute loop at least 4 times a week. She continues to attend \\nthe bird-watching group, and she feels more comfortable walking on uneven terrain; she has extended these \\nwalks to about 40 minutes a week. Rumi has also started going to an exercise class for older adults twice a \\nweek. The leader teaches different exercises that focus on aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity, and \\nbalance training. Rumi is now meeting the key guideline of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. \\nThis class has helped Rumi to meet the twice-weekly guideline for muscle-strengthening activities and adds \\nmulticomponent activities to her routine.'),\n",

Additional Considerations for Some Adults      79 \\nAll Americans should be physically active to improve overall health and fitness and to prevent many adverse \\nhealth outcomes. However, some people have conditions that raise special issues about recommended types \\nand amounts of physical activity. These people include healthy women during pregnancy and the postpartum \\nperiod (first year after delivery), people with chronic health conditions, and people with disabilities. Often, these \\npeople avoid physical activity because of concern that the risks outweigh the benefits. However, for most \\npeople, the benefits of being physically active outweigh any \\npotential risks. \\nThis chapter provides guidance on physical activity for healthy \\nwomen who are pregnant or postpartum. This chapter also \\nprovides guidance on physical activity for adults with selected \\nchronic conditions or disabilities, including the following: \\n  \\n• Adults with osteoarthritis;\\n  \\n• Adults with type 2 diabetes; \\n  \\n• Adults with hypertension; \\n  \\n• Adults who are cancer survivors; and \\n  \\n• Adults with physical disabilities. \\nFor the groups discussed in this chapter, either absolute or relative intensity can be used to monitor progress \\nin meeting the key guidelines. This chapter complements guidance provided in Chapter 4. Active Adults and \\nChapter 5. Active Older Adults, which discuss how to use relative intensity. \\nPhysical Activity in Women During Pregnancy and the  \\nPostpartum Period \\nPhysical activity during pregnancy benefits a woman’s overall health. Moderate-intensity physical activity by \\nhealthy women during pregnancy increases or maintains cardiorespiratory fitness, reduces the risk of excessive \\nweight gain and gestational diabetes, and reduces symptoms of postpartum depression. Reduced risk of \\nexcessive weight gain during pregnancy can also reduce the risk of excessive postpartum weight retention, \\nfuture obesity, and an infant born with high birth weight. Strong scientific evidence shows that the risks of \\nmoderate-intensity activity done by healthy women during pregnancy are very low, and do not increase risk of \\nlow birth weight, preterm delivery, or early pregnancy loss. Some evidence suggests that physical activity may \\nreduce the risk of pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, reduce the length of labor and postpartum \\nrecovery, and reduce the risk of having a Cesarean section. \\nDuring a normal postpartum period, regular physical activity continues to benefit a woman’s overall health. \\nStudies show that moderate-intensity physical activity during the period following the birth of a child increases \\na woman’s cardiorespiratory fitness and improves her mood. Such activity does not appear to have adverse \\neffects on breast milk volume, breast milk composition, or infant growth. \\nPhysical activity also helps women achieve and maintain a healthy weight during the postpartum period and, \\nwhen combined with caloric restriction, helps promote weight loss.\\nLearn More \\nSee Chapter 3.

Unless a woman \\nhas medical reasons to avoid physical activity during pregnancy or the postpartum period, she can begin or \\ncontinue light- to moderate-intensity aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity. When beginning \\nphysical activity during pregnancy, women should increase the amount of physical activity gradually over time. \\nWomen who habitually did vigorous-intensity activity or a lot of aerobic or muscle-strengthening physical \\nactivity before pregnancy can continue to be physically active during pregnancy and after giving birth. They \\ngenerally do not need to drastically reduce their activity levels, provided that they remain healthy and discuss \\nwith their health care provider whether and how to adjust activity levels during this time. \\nDuring pregnancy, perceived exertion is often a better indicator of intensity than heart rate or estimated \\nabsolute energy requirements of specific activities. On a rating-of-perceived-exertion scale of 0 to 10, where 0 \\nis sitting and 10 is the greatest effort possible, moderate-intensity activity would be an effort of 5 to 6. Another \\nway to gauge moderate intensity is with a talk test, where carrying on a conversation (but not singing) is still \\npossible. \\nWomen should avoid doing exercises that involve lying on their back after the first trimester of pregnancy \\nbecause this position can restrict blood flow to the uterus and fetus. They should also avoid participating \\nin contact or collision sports and activities with high risk of falling or abdominal trauma, such as soccer, \\nbasketball, horseback riding, or downhill skiing. \\nPhysical Activity in People With Chronic Health Conditions or Disabilities \\nThis section addresses both adults with chronic conditions and adults with disabilities.

The type and amount of physical activity should be determined \\nby a person’s abilities and the severity of the chronic condition. For many chronic conditions, physical activity \\nprovides therapeutic benefits and is part of recommended treatment for the condition. However, the Guidelines \\ndoes not discuss therapeutic exercise or rehabilitation, except in the context of how physical activity for disease \\nprevention and general health benefits can be done by people with chronic conditions. \\nThe benefits of physical activity for people with disabilities have been studied in diverse groups with disabilities \\nrelated to traumatic events or to chronic health conditions. These groups include stroke survivors and people \\nwith spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, traumatic \\nbrain injury, limb amputations, mental illness, intellectual disability, and Alzheimer’s disease and other \\ndementias.

Additional Considerations for Some Adults      83 \\nPeople with osteoarthritis should match the type and amount of physical activity to their abilities and the \\nseverity of their condition. Most people can usually tolerate doing moderate-intensity activity for 150 minutes \\na week or more, such as being active 3 to 5 days a week for 30 to 60 minutes per episode. Walking up to \\n10,000 steps per day does not appear to worsen osteoarthritis of the knee. Some people with osteoarthritis \\ncan safely do more than 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each week and may be able to tolerate \\nvigorous-intensity activity. Health care professionals typically counsel people with osteoarthritis to do activities \\nthat are low impact, not painful, and have low risk of joint injury. Swimming, walking, tai chi, and many muscle-\\nstrengthening exercises are good examples of this type of activity. \\nPhysical Activity in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes \\nPhysical activity in adults with type 2 diabetes shows how important it can be for people with a chronic \\ndisease to be active. Physical activity has therapeutic effects, can reduce comorbidities, and can prevent risk \\nfactors that contribute to the progression of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, in addition to benefits specific to type 2 \\ndiabetes, physical activity is routinely recommended to reduce risk of other diseases and help promote a healthy \\nbody weight. Physical activity may also benefit adults with type 1 diabetes, but this condition was not addressed \\nfor the development of the Guidelines. \\nStrong scientific evidence shows that physical activity protects against heart disease, the leading cause of \\ndeath in people with type 2 diabetes, and can reduce risk of death by 30 to 40 percent. Physical activity helps \\nprotect against heart disease and factors related to the progression of type 2 diabetes by helping to reduce the \\nrisk factors of high blood pressure, body weight, blood lipids (cholesterol), and elevated hemoglobin A1c in \\npeople with type 2 diabetes. The beneficial effects on blood glucose (indicated by hemoglobin A1c) may also \\nreduce other complications of type 2 diabetes. Moderate-intensity activity for at least 150 minutes a week plus \\n2 days a week of muscle-strengthening activities help to substantially lower the risk of heart disease. A person \\nwho moves toward 300 minutes or more of moderate-intensity activity a week gets even greater benefit. \\nAdults with a chronic condition should work with a health care professional or physical activity specialist \\nto adapt physical activity so it is appropriate for their condition. For example, people with diabetes must be \\nespecially careful about monitoring their blood glucose, choosing appropriate footwear, and avoiding injury  \\nto their feet. \\nPhysical Activity in Adults With Hypertension \\nHypertension is one of the most common, costly, and preventable cardiovascular disease risk factors. It is \\nthe most prevalent chronic condition among adults. Physical activity has therapeutic benefits for people with \\nhypertension by helping to reduce blood pressure. It also lowers their risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. \\nBoth aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities are beneficial for people with hypertension. Because the \\nbenefits of physical activity are actually greater in people with hypertension than in those with normal blood \\npressure, moderate-intensity activity for about 90 minutes a week or the equivalent amount of vigorous-intensity \\nactivity helps to substantially lower the risk of heart disease. A person who moves toward greater amounts of \\nphysical activity a week gets even greater benefit. People with hypertension should work with their health care \\nprovider as they increase their physical activity, as adjustments to medication may be needed.'),\n",

She also starts walking during her lunch break \\nfor 30 minutes 3 days a week, for a total of 90 minutes of moderate-\\nintensity activity. As she begins to gain strength and endurance, Jessica \\nadds a 60-minute walk and 30 minutes of muscle-strengthening activities with resistance bands each \\nweekend, modifying exercises to avoid lying on her back. With these additions, Jessica has reached 150 \\nminutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week and participates in 1 day of muscle strengthening.

The most common problems are musculoskeletal \\ninjuries. Even so, studies show that only one such injury \\noccurs for every 1,000 hours of walking for exercise, and \\nfewer than four injuries occur for every 1,000 hours of \\nrunning. \\nBoth physical fitness and total amount of physical activity \\naffect risk of musculoskeletal injuries. People who are \\nphysically fit have a lower risk of injury than people who are not. People who do more activity generally have a \\nhigher risk of injury. So, what should people do if they want to be active and safe? The best strategies are to:\\n  \\n• Be regularly physically active to increase physical fitness; and \\n  \\n• Follow the other guidance in this chapter (especially increasing physical activity gradually over time)  \\nto minimize the risk of injury. \\nChoose Appropriate Types and Amounts of Activity \\nPeople can reduce their risk of injury by choosing appropriate types of activity. The safest activities are \\nmoderate intensity, low impact, and do not involve purposeful collision or contact. \\nWalking for exercise, gardening or yard work, bicycling or riding a stationary bike, dancing, swimming, and \\ngolf are activities with the lowest injury rates. In the amounts commonly done by adults, walking (a moderate-\\nintensity and low-impact activity) has a third or less of the injury risk of running (a vigorous-intensity and higher \\nimpact activity). Sports that involve collision or contact, such as football, hockey, and soccer, have a higher risk \\nof injuries, including concussion. \\nThe risk of injury for a type of physical activity can also differ by the purpose of the activity. For example, \\nrecreational bicycling or bicycling for transportation leads to fewer injuries than training for and competing  \\nin bicycle races. \\nPeople who have had a past injury are at risk of re-injuring that body part. The risk of injury can be reduced  \\nby performing appropriate amounts of activity and setting appropriate personal goals. Performing a variety  \\nof different physical activities may also reduce the risk of overuse injury.'),\n",

Creating \\na small overload and waiting for the body to adapt and \\nrecover reduces the risk of injury. When amounts of physical \\nactivity need to be increased to meet the key guidelines or \\npersonal goals, physical activity should be increased gradually \\nover time, no matter what the person’s current level of physical activity. Here is general guidance for inactive \\npeople and those with low levels of physical activity on how to increase physical activity:\\n  \\n• Use relative intensity (intensity of the activity relative to a person’s fitness) to guide the level of effort for \\naerobic or muscle-strengthening physical activity. \\n  \\n• Generally, start with relatively moderate-intensity activity. Avoid relatively vigorous-intensity activity, \\nsuch as shoveling heavy snow or running. Adults with low fitness may need to start with light activity, \\nor a mix of light- to moderate-intensity activity. \\n  \\n• First, increase the number of minutes per session (duration) and the number of days a week (frequency) \\nof moderate-intensity activity. Later, if desired, increase the intensity. \\n  \\n• Pay attention to the relative size of the increase in physical activity each week, as this is related  \\nto injury risk. For example, a 20-minute increase each week is safer for a person who already does  \\n200 minutes a week of jogging (a 10% increase) than in a person who does 40 minutes a week  \\n(a 50% increase). \\nThe available scientific evidence suggests that adding a small and comfortable amount of light- to moderate-\\nintensity activity, such as walking 5 to 15 minutes per session, 2 to 3 times a week, to one’s usual activities \\nresults in a low risk of musculoskeletal injury and no known risk of severe cardiac events. Because this range \\nis rather wide, people should consider three factors when individualizing their rate of increase—age, level of \\nfitness, and level of experience. \\nAge \\nThe amount of time required to adapt to a new level of activity probably depends upon age. Youth and young \\nadults probably can safely increase activity by small amounts every week or two. Older adults appear to \\nrequire more time to adapt to a new level of activity, in the range of 2 to 4 weeks. \\nLevel of Fitness  \\nLess fit adults are at higher risk of injury when doing a given amount of activity, compared to more fit adults. \\nSlower rates of increase over time may reduce injury risk. This guidance applies particularly to adults with \\noverweight or obesity, as they are commonly less physically fit. \\nLearn More \\nSee Chapter 2. Physical Activity \\nand Health for a discussion of overload, \\nprogression, and specificity and how \\nthey relate to physical fitness.'),\n",

Generally, if an overuse injury occurred in the past with a certain rate of progression, a person \\nshould increase activity more slowly the next time. \\nWarming up before and cooling down after exercise are commonly recommended to prevent injuries and \\nadverse cardiac events.

To help \\nthem stay safe, people can look for:\\n  \\n• Physical separation from motor vehicles, such as sidewalks, walking paths, or bike lanes;\\n  \\n• Neighborhoods with traffic-calming measures that slow traffic;\\n  \\n• Places to be active that are well lit, where other people are present, and that are well maintained;\\n  \\n• Shock-absorbing surfaces on playgrounds;\\n  \\n• Well-maintained playing fields and courts without holes or obstacles; \\n  \\n• Breakaway bases at baseball and softball fields; and\\n  \\n• Padded and anchored goals and goal posts at soccer and football fields. \\nFollow Rules and Policies That Promote Safety \\nRules, policies, and laws are potentially the most effective and wide-reaching way to reduce activity-related \\ninjuries. To get the benefit, people should look for and follow these rules, policies, and laws. For example, \\npolicies that promote the use of bicycle helmets reduce the risk of head injury among bicyclists. Rules against \\ndiving into shallow water at swimming pools prevent head and neck injuries. \\nMake Sensible Choices About When and How to Be Active \\nA person’s choices can obviously influence the risk of adverse events. By making sensible choices, injuries and \\nadverse events can be prevented. For example, wearing reflective clothing and lights when doing outdoor \\nactivities (walking, running, or bicycling) in the early morning or evening can help increase visibility. Consider \\nweather conditions such as extremes of heat and cold, and apply sunscreen as appropriate. For example, \\nduring very hot and humid weather, people lessen the chances of dehydration and heat stress by:\\n  \\n• Exercising in the cool of early morning as opposed to mid-day heat;\\n  \\n• Switching to indoor activities (playing basketball in the gym rather than on the playground);\\n  \\n• Changing the type of activity (swimming rather than playing soccer); \\n  \\n• Lowering the intensity of activity (walking rather than running); and\\n  \\n• Paying close attention to resting, seeking shade, drinking enough fluids, and finding other ways  \\nto minimize effects of heat. \\nConsider Air Quality When Planning to Be Active \\nExposure to air pollution is associated with several adverse health outcomes, including asthma attacks and \\ncardiovascular disease-related events. People who can modify the location or time of exercise may wish to \\nreduce these risks by exercising away from heavy traffic and industrial sites, especially during rush hour or \\ntimes when pollution is known to be high. The Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality Index (AQI) provides \\ninformation about when air conditions are unhealthy. The AQI can be found at https://www.airnow.gov/.'),\n",

People \\nwith symptoms or known chronic conditions should be under the regular care of a health care provider. In \\nconsultation with a health care professional or physical activity specialist, they can develop a physical activity \\nplan that is appropriate for them. People with chronic conditions typically find that moderate-intensity activity  \\nis safe and beneficial. However, they may need to take special precautions. For example, people with diabetes \\nneed to pay special attention to blood glucose control and proper footwear during activity. \\nLight- and moderate-intensity physical activity are generally \\nsafe and are recommended for women with uncomplicated \\npregnancies, but women should talk with their providers about \\nhow to adjust their activity while they are pregnant and after \\nthe baby’s birth. \\nDuring pregnancy, women should avoid:\\n  \\n• Doing activities that involve lying on their back after \\nthe first trimester of pregnancy; and\\n  \\n• Doing contact or collision sports and activities with high risk of falling or abdominal trauma, such as \\nsoccer, basketball, horseback riding, or downhill skiing. \\nLearn More \\nSee Chapter 4.

However, providing guidance by \\nitself is rarely sufficient to produce change. In 2015, only \\nabout 20 percent of high school students and adults reported \\ngetting enough physical activity to meet the aerobic and \\nmuscle-strengthening key guidelines. To make progress, \\naction is necessary. \\nFor those who are not yet physically active, the news is \\ngood—a number of proven strategies can help increase levels \\nof physical activity. This chapter highlights several evidence-\\nbased strategies individuals and communities can take. \\nBecause improving physical activity across the country will \\nrequire the efforts of individuals, families, and many sectors of \\nsociety, the chapter closes with steps everyone can take. \\nEvidence-Based Strategies \\nTo most effectively increase physical activity levels, evidence-based strategies should be used. This means  \\nthat researchers or practitioners have tested the strategy and shown that it can increase physical activity. \\nA review of the science shows that many evidence-based strategies can be used to promote and support \\nphysical activity. Some strategies involve working with people one-on-one or in small groups to change their \\nphysical activity. Other strategies can be implemented more broadly at the community level through programs, \\npractices, and policies that make physical activity an easy choice. These evidence-based strategies show that \\nmaking physical activity the safe and easy choice does help people become more active. \\nFor Individuals or Small Groups \\nStrategies targeting individuals can benefit all age groups, including children, adolescents, adults, and older \\nadults. Many ways exist to deliver information and guidance to these groups to motivate their participation in \\nphysical activity. \\nStudies with individuals or small groups show that interventions based on theories of behavior change are \\nsuccessful in helping people achieve an active lifestyle.

They also use structured problem-solving to prevent relapse to \\nan inactive or low active lifestyle. To reduce staff burden and costs, groups can also be led by trained peers who \\ndeliver the intervention in full or in part and often share similar characteristics or experiences as group members. \\nYouth, adults, and older adults can benefit from using these strategies to achieve an active lifestyle. \\nSupport From Others \\nParticipation in physical activity in a community setting with others, such as friends and family, can increase \\nphysical activity levels. Adults are more likely to participate in physical activity when they are supported by \\nothers. Buddy systems, contracts with others to complete specified levels of physical activity, and walking \\ngroups are ways to provide individuals with friendship and support for physical activity. \\nTechnology  \\nTechnology-based approaches can take many forms. They can be used to provide virtual coaching to help \\npeople set and monitor physical activity goals. They can be used alone or combined with other strategies. Step \\ncounters (pedometers) and other wearable activity monitors combined with behavioral strategies, such as \\ngoal-setting and coaching, increase physical activity by providing physical activity feedback directly to the user. \\nTechnology can also be used to provide guidance remotely to individuals through text messaging, by telephone, \\nor through the Internet. Telephone and Internet delivery strategies offer guidance to individuals from trained \\npeers or through interactive voice-response systems. For those with lower computer or technology literacy \\nor living in remote areas, computer-tailored mailings can increase physical activity. Use of smartphone \\napplications can increase regular physical activity in children and adolescents. \\nFor Communities \\nAlthough individuals make the final choice about whether to be physically active, they can face challenges \\nthat make this choice more difficult. For example, they may not know about or have access to safe places to be \\nphysically active, may live in communities not designed for activity, or may have chronic conditions or physical \\nlimitations that create additional barriers. Through programs, practices, and policies, communities can help \\nindividuals overcome these challenges and make physical activity the easy choice. \\nStrategies at the community level generally have greater reach and can result in longer lasting change than \\nstrategies focused on individual behavior. Actions can be taken across an entire community or within settings \\nin the community, such as schools. The following are five proven strategies to show how this can work.'),\n",

Taking Action: Increasing Physical Activity Levels of Americans      97 \\nPoint-of-Decision Prompts \\nThese interventions provide signs or other prompts that \\nencourage people to make an active choice, such as taking \\nthe stairs instead of elevators or escalators. They can be done \\nin a variety of places, including worksites or public venues, \\nsuch as transportation hubs and shopping malls. Wayfinding \\nsigns placed at strategic points can make people aware of \\nwalkable destinations, including parks, recreational facilities, \\nand other attractions. \\nSchool Policies and Practices \\nSchools can use a variety of effective interventions to \\nincrease physical activity before, during, and after school. \\nEvidence-based strategies include improving physical \\neducation (PE); providing classroom physical activity breaks; \\nproviding programs, space, or equipment for physical activity \\nbefore and after school; and building behavioral skills related \\nto physical activity participation. \\nPhysical education class policies are one vehicle for these interventions. Strategies that schools can use to \\nincrease physical activity during PE include employing a well-designed curriculum, changing instructional \\npractices to better incorporate more time for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and providing teachers \\nwith appropriate training. \\nAccess to Indoor or Outdoor Recreation Facilities or Outlets \\nThese interventions provide or improve places to be active in the community. The places can be indoors, \\nsuch as gyms or on-site fitness rooms at worksites, or outdoors, such as parks, trails, or other green spaces. \\nInterventions to improve access can be more effective if they also include outreach efforts that make people \\naware of the place or facilities and the physical activity opportunities available there. \\nCommunity-Wide Campaigns \\nCommunity-wide campaigns are intensive interventions that involve groups across the community working \\ntogether. They are designed to be visible, sustainable, and reach large numbers of people in the community and \\noften involve many groups in the community. The interventions generally combine physical activity messaging \\nwith community activities focused on physical activity. The messages are often delivered through multiple \\nchannels, including television, radio, and written materials. Associated community activities can include efforts \\nthat focus on individuals, such as providing counseling or support groups, or that focus on the community \\nenvironment, such as developing and promoting walking trails.'),\n",

This includes locating destinations such as schools, stores, or public \\ntransportation near homes or workplaces so that people can easily walk, bike, or wheelchair walk there. It \\nincludes making routes to these places more accommodating for walkers, bicyclists, or wheelchair users by \\nmaking them safer and more seamlessly connected. For example, sidewalks and paths can be added and \\nkept well maintained and well lit, streets can be designed to reduce speeds or separate bicyclists from motor \\nvehicles, and street networks can have shorter blocks and more intersections with crosswalks or traffic signals. \\nEveryone Has a Role to Play  \\nto Increase Physical Activity \\nEveryone has a role to play to increase physical activity levels \\nof Americans. Individuals can take steps to increase their own \\nphysical activity. Families and caregivers can help youth be \\nactive. Community groups, such as faith groups, businesses, \\ncivic organizations, parent-teacher associations, health \\ngroups, and public safety agencies, can provide opportunities \\nand encouragement for physical activity. This section \\nillustrates ways that individuals, families and caregivers, and \\ncommunity groups can take action to make physical activity \\nsafe, easy, and enjoyable. \\nWhat Can Individuals Do to Get Enough \\nPhysical Activity? \\nIndividuals can take a variety of steps to adopt an active lifestyle. \\nPersonalize the Benefits of Regular Physical Activity \\nAdults need to identify benefits of personal value to them. For some people, the health benefits, which are the \\nfocus of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, are compelling enough to motivate them to be active. \\nFor others, different reasons are key motivators to be active. For example, physical activity: \\n  \\n• Provides opportunities to enjoy recreational activities, often in a social setting;\\n  \\n• Improves personal appearance and feelings of energy and well-being;\\n  \\n• Provides a chance to help a family member or friend be active; and\\n  \\n• Gives older adults a greater opportunity to live independently in the community. \\nSet Personal Goals for Physical Activity \\nIndividuals should set goals for activity that allow them to achieve the benefits they value. In setting goals, \\npeople can consider doing a variety of activities and try both indoor and outdoor activities. Simple goals are \\nfine. For example, a brisk walk in the neighborhood with friends for 45 minutes on 3 days a week and walking \\nto lunch twice a week may be just the right approach for someone who wants to increase both physical activity'),\n",

For example, a person may create a physical \\nactivity plan that is aimed at training for a 10-kilometer community run. Activities that are multipurpose are \\nanother way for people to incorporate physical activity into their busy lives. For example, people can use active \\ntransportation—walking, biking, or wheelchair walking—to get to school, work, or a store. \\nDevelop Knowledge and Skills to Attain Goals \\nIt is important to learn about the types and amounts of activity needed to attain personal goals. For example, \\nif weight loss is a goal, it is useful to know that vigorous-intensity activity can be more time-efficient in burning \\ncalories than moderate-intensity activity. If running is a goal, it is important to learn how to reduce risk of \\nrunning injuries by selecting an appropriate training program and proper shoes. If regular walking is a goal, \\nlearning about neighborhood walking trails can help a person attain this goal. \\nWhat Can Families and Caregivers Do to Help Youth Get  \\nEnough Physical Activity? \\nChildren and adolescents are naturally physically active, and they need opportunities to be active and to learn \\nskills. They benefit from encouragement from parents and other adults. Adults can promote age-appropriate \\nactivity in children and adolescents through these steps:\\n  \\n• Start early. Young children love to play and be active. Encouraging lots of safe and unstructured \\nmovement and play at home and in the neighborhood can help build a strong foundation in which \\nchildren understand that being physically active can and should be a healthy habit throughout their lives.\\n  \\n• Provide time for both structured and unstructured physical activity during school and outside \\nof school. School-aged children need time for active play. Through recess, physical activity breaks, \\nphysical education classes, team and individual sports and other after-school programs, and active \\ntime with family and friends, youth can learn about physical activity and spend time doing it. \\n  \\n• Provide youth with positive feedback and good role models. Parents, caregivers, and teachers \\nshould model and encourage an active lifestyle for children. Praise, rewards, and encouragement help \\nchildren to be active. Being active as a family is a great way to model and encourage physical activity.\\n  \\n• Help young people learn skills required to do physical activity safely. As appropriate for their age, \\nyouth need to understand how to regulate the intensity of activity, increase physical activity gradually \\nover time, set goals, use protective gear and proper equipment, follow rules, and avoid injuries.\\n  \\n• Promote activities that set the basis for a lifetime of activity. Children and adolescents should be \\nexposed to a variety of activities, including active recreation, team sports, and individual sports. In this \\nway, they can find activities they can do well and enjoy, including activities that adults commonly do, \\nsuch as jogging, bicycling, hiking, swimming, exercise classes, and strength training. Young people should \\nexperience noncompetitive activities, and activities that do not require above-average athletic skills.'),\n",

Although all groups can benefit from efforts to make physical activity \\neasier, attention to underserved groups or those with barriers to physical activity is particularly needed. \\nThe National Physical Activity Plan Alliance is a nonprofit organization that has a memorandum of \\nunderstanding with HHS to help promote physical activity. The 2016 National Physical Activity Plan (http:// \\nwww.physicalactivityplan.org/index.html) identified nine sectors of society that have a role to play in promoting \\nphysical activity. This section briefly illustrates some of the roles that each sector can play—and in some cases \\nare already playing—in promoting physical activity. \\n  \\n• Business and Industry. Employers can encourage workers to be physically active. They can provide \\naccess to facilities and encourage their use through outreach activities. Businesses can consider access \\nto opportunities for active transportation and public transit when selecting new locations. \\n  \\n• Community Recreation, Fitness, and Parks. This sector plays a leading role in providing access to \\nplaces for active recreation, such as playgrounds, hiking and biking trails, senior centers, sports fields, \\nand swimming pools. This sector can also provide access to exercise programs and equipment for a \\nwide variety of people, including underserved populations and people with disabilities. \\n  \\n• Education. This sector can take a lead role in providing opportunities for age-appropriate physical \\nactivity in all educational settings. Opportunities include offering physical education, after-school \\nsports, public access to school facilities during after-school hours, and expanded intramural sports and \\ncampus recreation opportunities. \\n  \\n• Faith-Based Settings. Faith-based organizations can be important partners in providing access to \\nplaces for physical activity and promotion through outreach activities that can be tailored for diverse, \\nfaith-based groups.\\n  \\n• Health Care. Health care professionals can assess, counsel, and advise patients on physical activity \\nand how to do it safely. Health care systems can partner with other sectors to promote access to \\ncommunity-based physical activity programs.\\n  \\n• Mass Media. Media outlets can provide easy-to-understand messages about the health benefits of \\nphysical activity as part of community promotion efforts. Messages can also provide information  \\nabout facilities or outlets where individuals can be active. \\n  \\n• Public Health. Public health departments can monitor community progress in providing places and \\nopportunities to be physically active and track changes in the proportion of the population meeting \\nthe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans. They can also take the lead in setting objectives and \\ncoordinating activities among sectors. Public health departments and organizations can disseminate \\nappropriate messages and information to the public about physical activity.\\n  \\n• Sports. This sector can provide organized opportunities for people to be active. Youth sports  \\ncan expose children and adolescents to a variety of age-appropriate activities that can set the basis  \\nfor a lifetime of activity. Sports organizations can also ensure that sports programs are conducted in  \\na manner that minimizes risk of injuries.'),\n",

Taking Action: Increasing Physical Activity Levels of Americans      101 \\n  \\n• Transportation, Land Use, and Community Design. This sector plays a lead role in designing and \\nimplementing options that provide areas for safe walking, bicycling, and wheelchair walking. Public \\ntransit systems also promote walking, as people typically walk to and from transit stops. Community \\nplanners and designers can implement design principles to create communities with activity-friendly \\nroutes to everyday destinations for people of all ages and abilities. They can also help create or \\nimprove access to places for physical activity, such as parks and other green spaces. \\nTaking Action \\nImproving the physical activity levels of Americans will not be a small task. Many partners are already involved, \\nbut more engagement is needed to increase the reach, breadth, and impact of these efforts. Realizing a \\nshared vision of a more physically active and healthy America will require the dedication, ingenuity, skill, and \\ncommitment from many partners working across many different sectors. Being physically active is one of the \\nbest investments individuals and communities can make in their health and welfare. Now is the time to take \\naction and help more Americans attain the numerous benefits of physical activity. \\nGetting and Staying Active: Real-Life \\nExamples \\nJim: A 75-Year-Old Man Who Uses a Pedometer  \\nto Track His Increasing Activity \\nEstablishing baseline: Jim does not yet meet the key guidelines, but \\nhe wants to increase his physical activity so he can continue to live \\nindependently in his own home. Jim spends 45 minutes each week taking \\ncare of his yard and garden. He also spends about 55 minutes cleaning \\nthe inside of his house, including vacuuming, cleaning bathrooms, and \\nwashing the floors. He is participating in 100 minutes of moderate-\\nintensity physical activity each week. \\nSetting goals: Jim wants to add at least 60 additional minutes of moderate-intensity walking to each week. He \\npurchases an inexpensive step counter to help set his physical activity goal and monitor his progress. Before \\nstarting to incorporate any extra walking, Jim wears his new step counter for one day and finds he gets 5,100 \\nsteps. He then wears his step counter on a 10-minute, moderate-intensity walk around his neighborhood and \\nnotes that this adds about 1,000 steps. Based on his initial activity, Jim sets a goal of adding 10 minutes of \\nwalking each day, which would add 6,000 extra steps a week with 60 minutes of moderate-intensity walking. \\nReaching his goal: To reach his goal, Jim uses strategies like parking at the back of the parking lot when \\nhe goes shopping, walking to a nearby convenience store to pick up ingredients for dinner, or walking to a \\nneighbor’s house. Over time, he builds up to the equivalent of 160 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic \\nactivity each week.'),\n",

Leaders wanted to ensure that the community \\nmade it safe and convenient for people of all ages and abilities to be \\nphysically active. \\nOfficials began by forming a coalition of public health, transportation, \\nlocal business, parks and recreation, city planning, and community \\nresidents to identify shared goals. The coalition also conducted a \\nbaseline assessment to document physical activity levels of residents and to identify opportunities for \\nimprovement related to community supports to promote physical activity. \\nBased on this assessment, and available skills and resources, the coalition developed a 10-year action plan \\nthat included strategies organized by three areas of focus.\\n  \\n•  Improve residents’ access to places to be active in the community.\\n  \\n• Offer free yoga classes for older adults at local senior centers.\\n  \\n• Work with local schools to share gyms, playgrounds, or sports facilities with residents.\\n  \\n• Convert an unused building to a community recreation center.\\n  \\n• Develop a multi-use path from a residential area to the town retail center.\\n  \\n• Construct wheelchair-accessible bus stops along transit routes to grocery stores.\\n  \\n•  Improve pedestrian and cyclist safety.\\n  \\n• Create safe crossings within one mile of all schools.\\n  \\n• Construct protected bike lanes within the retail district and surrounding the city park.\\n  \\n•  Increase the use of existing community resources for physical activity.\\n  \\n• Increase awareness of safe routes to parks and trails by adding signage.\\n  \\n• Add lights to local parks so they can be used at night. \\nThe coalition then developed a plan to implement these strategies. The plan identified who would work on each \\nproject, what resources would be needed, and the timeline. For example: \\n  \\n• The Anytown School District agreed to pay for an adult safety guard at the three major street crossings \\nwithin one mile of the local elementary school starting in the next school year. \\n  \\n• The Parks and Recreation Department will include money in their annual budget to add lights to one \\ndifferent community park each year for the next three years.\\n  \\n• The Mayor’s Office will apply for a grant from a foundation next year to create the community center.'),\n",

It has been adapted \\nfrom the glossary provided in the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report. It is \\nnot meant to be an exhaustive list, and definitions of additional terms can be found in the Scientific Report. \\nAbsolute intensity. See Intensity. \\nAdaptation. The body’s response to exercise or activity. Some of the body’s structures and functions favorably \\nadjust to the increase in demands placed on them whenever physical activity of a greater amount or higher \\nintensity is performed than what is usual for the individual. These adaptations are the basis for much of the \\nimproved health and fitness associated with increases in physical activity. \\nAdverse event. In the context of physical activity, a negative health event. Examples of adverse events as \\na result of physical activity include musculoskeletal injuries (injury to bone, muscles, or joints), heat-related \\nconditions (heat exhaustion), and cardiovascular events (heart attack or stroke). \\nAerobic physical activity. Activity in which the body’s large muscles move in a rhythmic manner for a sustained \\nperiod of time. Aerobic activity, also called endurance or cardio activity, improves cardiorespiratory fitness. Examples \\ninclude brisk walking, running, swimming, and bicycling. Aerobic activity has three components:\\n  \\n• Intensity, or how hard a person works to do the activity. The intensities most often studied are \\nmoderate (equivalent in effort to brisk walking) and vigorous (equivalent in effort to running or jogging); \\n  \\n• Frequency, or how often a person does aerobic activity; and\\n  \\n• Duration, or how long a person does an activity in any one session. \\nBalance. A component of physical fitness that involves maintaining the body’s equilibrium while stationary  \\nor moving. \\nBalance training. Static and dynamic exercises that are designed to improve individuals’ ability to resist forces \\nwithin or outside of the body that cause falls while a person is stationary or moving. Walking backward, standing \\non one leg, or using a wobble board are examples of balance-training activities. \\nBody composition. A health-related component of physical fitness that applies to body weight and the relative \\namounts of muscle, fat, bone, and other vital tissues of the body. Most often, the components are limited to fat \\nand lean body mass (or fat-free mass). \\nBone-strengthening activity. Physical activity designed primarily to increase the strength of specific sites in \\nbones that make up the skeletal system. Bone-strengthening activities produce an impact or tension force on \\nthe bones that promotes bone growth and strength. Running, jumping rope, and lifting weights are examples  \\nof bone-strengthening activities. \\nGlossary'),\n",

All exercise is physical activity, but not all physical activity is exercise. \\nFitness. See Physical fitness. \\nFlexibility. A health- and performance-related component of physical fitness that is the range of motion \\npossible at a joint. Flexibility is specific to each joint and depends on a number of specific variables, including  \\nbut not limited to the tightness of specific muscles and tendons. Flexibility exercises enhance the ability of  \\na joint to move through its full range of motion. \\nFunctional limitation. Loss of functional ability, or the ability to carry out everyday tasks and life roles. \\nHealth. A human condition with physical, social, and psychological dimensions, each characterized on a \\ncontinuum with positive and negative poles. Positive health is associated with a capacity to enjoy life and  \\nto withstand challenges; it is not merely the absence of disease. Negative health is associated with illness,  \\nand in the extreme, with premature death. \\nHealth-related fitness. A type of physical fitness aimed at promoting health and reducing risk of chronic \\ndisease and that includes cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and endurance, body composition, \\nflexibility, and balance. \\nIntensity. Intensity refers to how much work is being performed or the magnitude of the effort required to \\nperform an activity or exercise. Intensity can be expressed either in absolute or relative terms. \\n  \\n• Absolute. The absolute intensity of an activity is determined by the rate of work being performed and \\ndoes not consider the physiologic capacity of the individual. For aerobic activity, absolute intensity \\ntypically is expressed as the rate of energy expenditure (for example, milliliters per kilogram of body \\nweight per minute of oxygen being consumed, kilocalories per minute, or METs; see MET definition \\nbelow). For muscle-strengthening activities, intensity frequently is expressed as the amount of \\nweight lifted or moved. \\n  \\n• Light-intensity activity is non-sedentary waking behavior that requires less than 3.0 METs; \\nexamples include walking at a slow or leisurely pace (2 mph or less), cooking activities, or light \\nhousehold chores.\\n  \\n• Moderate-intensity activity requires 3.0 to 5.9 METs; examples include walking briskly or with \\npurpose (2.5 to 4 mph), mopping or vacuuming, or raking the yard.\\n  \\n• Vigorous-intensity activity requires 6.0 or more METs; examples include walking very fast (4.5 to 5 \\nmph), running, carrying heavy groceries or other loads upstairs, shoveling snow, or participating in \\na strenuous fitness class. Many adults do no vigorous-intensity activity.\\n  \\n• Relative. Relative intensity takes into account or adjusts for a person’s cardiorespiratory fitness. \\nFor aerobic exercise, relative intensity is expressed as a percentage of a person’s aerobic capacity \\n(VO2max) or VO2 reserve, or as a percentage of a person’s measured or estimated maximum heart rate \\nor heart rate reserve. It also can be expressed as an index of how hard the person feels he or she is \\nexercising (for example, on a 0 to 10 scale).'),\n",

A metabolic equivalent of task, \\nor MET, is a unit useful for describing the energy expenditure of a specific activity. A MET is the ratio of the rate \\nof energy expended during an activity to the rate of energy expended at rest. For example, 1 MET is the rate \\nof energy expenditure while at rest. A 4 MET activity expends 4 times the energy used by the body at rest. If a \\nperson does a 4 MET activity for 30 minutes, they have done 4 x 30 = 120 MET-minutes (or 2.0 MET-hours) of \\nphysical activity. A person could also achieve 120 MET-minutes by doing an 8 MET activity for 15 minutes. \\nTwo Methods of Assessing Aerobic Intensity \\nThe intensity of aerobic physical activity can be defined in absolute or relative terms. \\nAbsolute Intensity \\nAbsolute aerobic intensity is defined in terms of METs, as described above: \\n  \\n• Light-intensity activities are defined as waking non-sedentary behaviors of less than 3.0 METs. \\nWalking at 2.0 miles per hour requires 2.5 METs of energy expenditure and is therefore considered  \\na light-intensity activity.\\n  \\n• Moderate-intensity activities are defined as 3.0 to 5.9 METs. Walking at 3.0 miles per hour requires 3.5 \\nMETs of energy expenditure and is therefore considered a moderate-intensity activity.\\n  \\n• Vigorous-intensity activities are defined as 6.0 METs or more. Running a mile in 10 minutes (6.0 mph)  \\nis a 10 MET activity and is therefore classified as a vigorous-intensity activity. \\nInformation on the absolute intensity of many activities for adults can be found in the Compendium of Physical \\nActivities (https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/home).

Physical Activity Behaviors: Intensity, Bouts, and Steps      109 \\nRelative Intensity \\nIntensity can also be defined relative to fitness, with the intensity expressed in terms of a percent of a person’s \\nmaximal heart rate, heart rate reserve, or aerobic capacity reserve. For example, relative moderate intensity is \\ndefined as 40 percent to 59 percent of aerobic capacity reserve (where 0 percent of reserve is resting and 100 \\npercent of reserve is maximal effort). Relative vigorous-intensity activity is 60 percent to 84 percent of reserve. \\nTo better communicate the concept of relative intensity (or relative level of effort), a simpler definition is useful: \\n  \\n• Relatively moderate-intensity activity is a level of effort of 5 or 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is the \\nlevel of effort of sitting, and 10 is maximal effort. \\n  \\n• Relatively vigorous-intensity activity begins at a 7 or 8 on this scale. \\nUsing Minutes of Moderate- and Vigorous-Intensity Activity to Reach a Goal \\nPeople can meet the key guidelines by doing either moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity or a \\ncombination of both. A simple rule of thumb is that 1 minute of vigorous-intensity activity counts the same as 2 \\nminutes of moderate-intensity activity. The lower limit of vigorous-intensity physical activity (6.0 METs) is twice \\nthe lower limit of moderate-intensity activity (3.0 METs). Therefore, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity a \\nweek is roughly equivalent to 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week. The recommendation that \\nadults do 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity \\nphysical activity are both equivalent to doing about 500-1,000 MET-minutes a week. Because the MET range \\nfor vigorous-intensity physical activity has no upper limit, highly fit people can exceed 1,000 MET-minutes in 75 \\nminutes if they do activities requiring 13.4 METs or more (running at approximately a 7.5 minute-per-mile pace \\nor faster). This amount of activity will provide additional health benefits. \\nUsing Relative Intensity to Meet Guidelines Expressed in Terms  \\nof Absolute Intensity \\nThe aerobic key guideline uses METs (i.e., absolute intensity) of 3.0 to 5.9 METs for moderate-intensity activities \\nand 6.0 METs or greater for vigorous-intensity activities. However, the key guidelines for adults indicate that \\nrelative intensity can also be used as a means of assessing the intensity of aerobic activities. \\nFor many adults, activities will be similar, whether considering relative or absolute intensity. When reasonably fit \\nadults do absolute moderate-intensity activities in the range of 3.0 to 5.9 METs, they generally are also doing \\nrelative moderate-intensity activity. Similarly, absolute vigorous-intensity and relative vigorous-intensity activities \\noverlap a great deal. \\nFor adults with greater levels of fitness, using relative intensity means they will do greater amounts of activity \\nthan the key guidelines. For example, a 3.5 MET activity can be relatively light intensity for these adults, and \\nperhaps 6.0 MET activities are relatively moderate. Doing 150 minutes of a 6.0 MET activity will exceed the \\nminimum amount of activity in the key guidelines. This is acceptable for two reasons. First, the key guidelines \\nencourage people to do more activity to gain additional health benefits. Second, people with higher fitness are \\nlikely choosing to do greater amounts of activity to maintain that fitness.'),\n",

Therefore, activities in the range of 3.0 to 5.9 METs will be relatively vigorous or physiologically \\nimpossible. Thus, the level of effort should be guided by relative as opposed to absolute intensity. As fitness \\nimproves with physical activity, activities with greater absolute intensity will be possible. \\nAllowing the Use of Either Relative Intensity or Absolute Intensity in Children \\nThe key guidelines for children and adolescents ages 6 through 17 years do not require careful tracking of  \\nthe intensity of activity. The mix of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity is flexible, if some \\nvigorous-intensity activity is done on at least 3 days a week. Intensity can be measured on either the  \\nabsolute or relative scale. \\nRelative intensity is appropriate because children and adolescents 6 through 17 years of age who follow  \\nthe key guidelines should experience improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, and the relative intensity  \\nof the activity is a major determinant of its fitness effects. Observing a youth’s breathing can provide an \\nindication of relative intensity. If a child breathes rapidly during physical activity, this indicates relatively \\nvigorous-intensity activity. \\nHowever, it is often not feasible to observe children closely enough to determine their level of effort. In this \\ncase, absolute intensity can be used to judge whether the child is doing activity that counts toward meeting the \\nkey guidelines. Absolute intensity varies by the age and sex of the child. Information on the absolute intensity \\nof various activities for children and adolescents ages 6 years and older is found in the Youth Compendium \\nof Physical Activities (https://www.nccor.org/tools-youthcompendium/). In general, similar to adults, brisk \\nwalking (as opposed to slow walking) counts as a moderate-intensity physical activity and running counts as a \\nvigorous-intensity activity. \\nThe key guidelines for children ages 3 through 5 years do not require careful monitoring of intensity. All intensities \\nand types of activities provide health benefits and count toward meeting the key guidelines. \\nWhat Is the Relationship Between Bout Duration of Physical Activity \\nand Health Outcomes? \\nHistorical Context \\nPhysical activity recommendations have traditionally focused on moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical \\nactivity performed in a continuous manner, such as in exercise. In the 1990s, the focus shifted to accumulating \\nphysical activity throughout the day in bouts as short as 10 minutes. The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for \\nAmericans included the guidance that activity needed to last 10 minutes to count. \\nEvolving Evidence \\nResearch continues to support the conclusion that physical activity accumulated in bouts of at least 10 minutes \\ncan improve a variety of health-related outcomes. In addition, new research indicates that bouts of any length of \\nmoderate-to-vigorous physical activity contribute to health benefits associated with the accumulated volume \\nof physical activity. This new evidence justified the current guidance that moderate-to-vigorous physical \\nactivity of any duration counts toward meeting the key guidelines.'),\n",

Physical Activity Behaviors: Intensity, Bouts, and Steps      111 \\nHow Are Steps Considered in the Guidelines? \\nSteps are a basic unit of locomotion and provide an easy-to-understand metric of ambulation (anything that \\nrequires steps, such as walking, dancing, or running). Measuring step counts combined with goal setting and \\nother behavioral approaches has been shown to increase physical activity levels. Step counts are generally \\nmeasured with wearable activity monitors, including step counters (pedometers, which measure number of \\nsteps over a given time) and accelerometers (which can measure both number of steps over a given time and \\nthe level of intensity of movement over a given time). Step counters are frequently included in health-tracking \\nsmart phone applications. \\nOver the past 10 years, expanding research and advances in technological approaches for measuring physical \\nactivity have led to examinations of the association of step counts with health outcomes and effective approaches \\nto promoting regular physical activity. The research evidence on the influence of incremental increases in the \\nnumber of steps per day on health outcomes is limited but is expanding rapidly. \\nMonitoring Physical Activity With Steps \\nMost of the technological approaches for measuring step counts used within research have provided total \\nstep counts for all physical activity over a day. The baseline number of steps per day has varied across studies \\nbut the typical amount is about 5,000 steps a day. It is estimated that 80 percent of daily steps among less \\nactive people are light intensity. Most research studies designed to increase physical activity have focused on \\nincreasing both the amount and intensity of physical activity above basic movement from daily life activities. \\nStudies that focus on steps often set targets of 10,000 steps a day or a percentage increase in steps a day to \\nencourage people to increase their amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. \\nIncreases in physical activity of any duration and any intensity are captured with step counters. Therefore,  \\nall types of activities that increase the number of steps taken during the day, such as taking stairs, doing \\nerrands by walking, or breaking up sedentary behavior by standing and moving during the work day, are \\nincluded in estimating total physical activity over a day. The key to using a step counter to monitor progress in \\nmeeting the key guidelines is to first set a time goal related to moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity \\n(minutes per day of brisk walking or other types of ambulation) and then to calculate how many steps are \\nneeded each day to reach that goal.

Using a Pedometer or Fitness Tracker to Track Walking \\nWalking is a popular and easy way to meet the key \\nguidelines, and pedometers or step counters are a \\nuseful way to track progress. Popular advice, such \\nas walking 10,000 steps a day, is not a guideline \\nper se, but a way people may choose to meet the \\nkey guidelines. The main idea in using a pedometer \\nto meet the key guidelines is to first set a time goal \\n(minutes of walking a day) and then calculate how \\nmany steps are needed each day to reach that goal. \\nModerate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity, \\nsuch as a brisk walk, counts toward meeting the key \\nguidelines. People generally need to plan episodes \\nof walking if they want to use step goals to progress \\ntoward meeting key guidelines. \\nAs a basis for setting step goals, it is preferable that \\npeople know how many steps they take per minute \\nof a brisk walk. A person with a lower fitness level, \\nwho takes fewer steps per minute than a fit adult, \\nwill need fewer steps to achieve the same time of walking. \\nOne way to set a step goal is the following: \\n1. To determine one’s usual daily steps, a person uses a pedometer or fitness tracker to count \\nthe number of steps taken on several ordinary days with no episodes of walking for exercise. \\nSuppose the average is about 5,000 steps a day. (Most of those steps are light-intensity activity.) \\n2. With the pedometer or fitness tracker, the person measures the number of steps taken \\nduring a 10-minute walk. Suppose this is 1,000 steps. For a goal of 20 minutes of walking, \\nthe goal would total 2,000 steps (1,000 times 2). \\n3. To calculate a daily step goal, add the usual daily steps (5,000) to the steps required for a \\n20-minute walk (2,000), to get the total steps per day (5,000 + 2,000 = 7,000). \\nThen, each week, the person gradually increases the number of total steps a day until the step goal \\nis reached. Rate of progression should be individualized. Some people who start out at 5,000 steps \\na day can add 500 steps per day each week. Others, who are less fit and starting out at a lower \\nnumber of steps, should add a smaller number of steps each week.'),\n",

Learning about these elements will help you assess \\nand improve your own fitness level.\\nEndurance\\nEndurance (en·DUR·uhnce) is the ability to perform difficult \\nphysical activity without getting overly tired. Muscle endurance \\nis the ability of a muscle to repeatedly use force over a period of time. \\nIf you can run several miles and if your legs don’t feel tired, your \\nlegs have muscle endurance. You can build your endurance if you \\nspend more time doing a chosen exercise or physical activity.\\nCardiovascular (kar·dee·oh·VASS·kyoo·luhr) endurance is \\nthe measure of how well your heart and lungs work during  moderate-\\nto-vigorous physical activity or exercise. If you are breathing so hard \\nyou can’t speak in sentences, your activity is vigorous. If you can \\ncarry on a conversation, your activity level is light to moder-\\nate. Cardiovascular endurance is also a measure of how quickly \\nyour heartbeat and breathing return to normal after you stop \\n exercising. \\nStrength\\nStrength is the ability of your muscles to use force. The amount \\nof work your muscles can do is a measure of strength. By build-\\ning muscle strength, you can improve your skills for sports and \\nother activities. You also shape and tone your body. Lifting \\nweights is one of the many ways to build and maintain muscle \\nstrength. \\nYour Responsibility \\nto Yourself\\nWhen you do what is best for \\nyour wellness, you are taking \\nresponsibility for your personal \\nhealth behaviors. This shows \\nthat you are mature. Others \\nwill trust you to make the right \\nchoices to care for yourself. \\nSet up an exercise plan and \\nstick to it. This is one way \\nyou can show others you are \\nworking toward becoming a \\nresponsible adult. Name three \\nactions you could take to set \\nup a fitness plan for yourself. \\nAcademic Vocabulary\\nelement (EL uh ment) \\n(noun) one of the parts \\nof which something is \\nmade up, the state or \\nplace natural or suited \\nto a person or thing.

Body com-\\nposition is the proportions of fat, bone, muscle, and fluid that make \\nup body weight. A healthy body generally has more bone, muscle, \\nand fluid than fat. Your body composition is the result of your \\neating habits, your level of physical activity, and genetics—the \\ngenes you inherited from your parents.\\nEffect of Body Composition on Fitness\\nYou can improve your body composition by eating healthy \\nfoods and increasing your physical activity. If you exercise regu-\\nlarly, your body can gain muscle and lose fat. This helps you stay \\nwithin a healthy weight range and helps to protect you against \\ndiseases like heart disease and cancer. Eating healthy foods and \\nexercising also helps keep your cholesterol levels down. Cholesterol \\nis a fatty substance in the blood that the body uses to build cells. \\nHigh cholesterol levels can contribute to heart disease.\\n'MFYJCJMJUZ\\n4USFUDIJOH\\x01JT\\x01POF\\x01XBZ\\x01\\nUP\\x01CVJME\\x01nFYJCJMJUZ\\x0f\\n4USFOHUI\\n8FJHIU\\x01USBJOJOH\\x01JT\\x01POF\\x01\\nXBZ\\x01UP\\x01CVJME\\x01TUSFOHUI\\x0e\\n&OEVSBODF\\n4XJNNJOH\\x01JT\\x01POF\\x01XBZ\\nUP\\x01CVJME\\x01FOEVSBODF\\x0f\\nFIGURE 3.2\\nEXERCISES FOR ENDURANCE, STRENGTH, AND FLEXIBILITY\\nDifferent exercises improve different elements of fitness.

Before you \\nbegin your workout, take your resting heart rate. This is the number \\nof times your heart beats per minute when you are relaxing. To \\ncheck your heart rate, take your pulse for 10 seconds. Multiply this \\nnumber by 6 to get your pulse rate for one minute. (To take your \\npulse, place the first two fingers of one hand on the inside of the \\nother wrist. You can also place them on either side of your neck. \\nDon’t use your thumb, which has its own pulse.)\\nAfter you have worked out for a while, take your target heart \\nrate. Your target heart rate is the number of heartbeats per minute \\nthat you should aim for during moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity to \\nhelp your circulatory system the most. Figure 3.11 above explains \\nhow to calculate the range of your target heart rate. After you com-\\nplete your workout, take your recovery heart rate.

They are second only to car crashes. Positive health prac-\\ntices such as wearing the proper safety equipment can help pre-\\nvent injuries. Some injuries, such as sore muscles, are considered \\nminor. Others, such as bone injuries, are considered major. \\nMinor Injuries\\nSore muscles are common when you are just beginning to \\nwork out or are trying a new activity. The soreness results from \\ntiny tears in the muscle fibers. These injuries heal quickly. You \\ncan reduce or prevent soreness if you warm up, stretch, and cool \\ndown properly. Also, if you’re not used to an activity, start slowly. \\nA muscle cramp is a pain caused by sudden tightening \\nof the muscle. Muscles become cramped when they \\nare overworked or dehydrated. Massaging and stretch-\\ning the muscle can ease cramps. So can drinking water \\nor specialty sports drinks.\\nSome injuries happen due to overwork. They \\ninclude strains, sprains, and tendonitis. A strain is \\ndamage to a tendon or muscle from overstretching. \\nA sprain is an injury to the ligament connecting bones \\nat a joint. Sprains occur when a ligament is torn or \\nstretched too far. Both strains and sprains can result \\nin pain and swelling. Severe sprains need medical \\ncare. Tendonitis is painful inflammation and swelling \\nof a tendon caused by overuse. Treatment often involves \\nrest, medicine to reduce inflammation, and physical \\ntherapy. Proper warm-ups and stretches can reduce \\nthe risk of strains, sprains, and tendonitis.\\n92  Chapter 3: Physical Activity and Fitness\\nPhysical activity injuries \\nare a common cause \\nof injury during the \\nteen years.

It often results from a blow to \\nthe head. A concussion can cause swelling of the brain and even \\ndeath. The person may feel dizzy or confused. Other signs include \\nheadache, loss of memory, or unconsciousness. Wearing a helmet \\nis the best safeguard against concussions and other head injuries. \\nIt is always important to seek out professional health services if \\nthere is any possibility of a concussion. \\nOther Health Problems\\nOverworking your body can make you feel dizzy and out of \\nbreath. Know your limits and strategies for maintaining your per-\\nsonal health. Take breaks, especially during hot weather. Drink \\nplenty of water and other fluids. Your body can overheat, which \\nmay lead to heat exhaustion or heatstroke. During heat exhaus-\\ntion, a person’s skin becomes cold and clammy. He or she may feel \\ndizzy or nauseated. During heatstroke, a person’s body tempera-\\nture suddenly increases. He or she has trouble breathing and may \\ncollapse. Heatstroke can be deadly. If you think someone has it, \\nget medical help right away.\\nIf a person’s body gets cold enough, its core temper-\\nature can drop dangerously low. Body systems begin \\nto shut down. This condition is called hypothermia. A \\nperson with hypothermia may become confused and \\nclumsy. Your body shivers when it needs heat. When \\nthis happens, warm yourself up. Get indoors. Wrap \\nyourself in a blanket, or put on warmer clothes. Have a \\nhot drink.\\nSkin can develop frostbite if it’s exposed to severe \\ncold and tissues freeze. Early signs of frostbite include \\nwhitening of the skin and a lack of feeling. If you \\nthink you have frostbite, get indoors right away and \\nwarm the exposed area with warm, not hot, water. \\nThen get medical help. \\nA sunburn makes the skin red and sore, and it might \\neven blister. Stay out of the sun during midday hours, \\nwhen the sun’s rays are strongest. Use a sunscreen with \\na sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15. Put it on \\nhalf an hour before you go outside. Cover your skin as \\nmuch as possible before going outdoors, and wear a hat. \\nAlso wear sunglasses, because the sun’s rays can hurt \\nyour eyes. \\n \\n Identify What are the symptoms \\nof heat exhaustion?\\nCalculating SPF\\nHow high should the SPF \\nrating on your sunblock be? \\nSPF is a measurement based \\non 15-minute increments. For \\nexample, an SPF of 8 means \\nyou can safely stay out for \\n8 times 15, or 120 minutes. \\nSunblock with a rating of \\nat least 15 is suggested for \\nmost outdoor activities. It \\nwill protect you for up to \\n225 minutes.

This will keep the injury from swelling. It \\nwill also help keep that part of your body motionless. \\nJust be careful not to wrap the bandage too tightly, which \\ncan cut off blood flow.\\n•\\nElevate the injured part above the level of the heart.\\nRemember to report any injury right away to a coach or teacher \\nand your parents or guardians.

Moving \\nmore and sitting less have tremendous benefits for everyone, regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or current \\nfitness level. Individuals with a chronic disease or a disability benefit from regular physical activity, as do \\nwomen who are pregnant. The scientific evidence continues to build—physical activity is linked with even more \\npositive health outcomes than we previously thought. And, even better, benefits can start accumulating with \\nsmall amounts of, and immediately after doing, physical activity. \\nToday, about half of all American adults—117 million people—have one or more preventable chronic diseases. \\nSeven of the ten most common chronic diseases are favorably influenced by regular physical activity. Yet nearly \\n80 percent of adults are not meeting the key guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity,'),\n",

The evidence reviewed for this second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans is \\nclear—physical activity fosters normal growth and development and can make people feel better, function \\nbetter, sleep better, and reduce the risk of a large number of chronic diseases. Health benefits start immediately \\nafter exercising, and even short episodes of physical activity are beneficial. Even better, research shows that \\njust about everyone gains benefits: men and women of all races and ethnicities, young children to older adults, \\nwomen who are pregnant or postpartum (first year after delivery), people living with a chronic condition or a \\ndisability, and people who want to reduce their risk of chronic disease.

Many studied \\ninterventions combine all types of \\nexercise (aerobic, muscle strengthening, \\nand balance) into one session, and this \\nhas been shown to be effective. \\nAn example of a multicomponent \\nphysical activity program could include \\nwalking (aerobic activity), lifting \\nweights (muscle strengthening), and \\ncould incorporate balance by walking \\nbackwards or sideways or by standing \\non one foot while doing an upper \\nbody muscle-strengthening activity, \\nsuch as bicep curls.
